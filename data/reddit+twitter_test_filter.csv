Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 12th, 2018.

# **Dow drops 200 points on worries about slowing global economic growth** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/09/stock-market-us-futures-lower-after-fed-decision.html)*
*****
> Stocks fell on Friday as further losses in oil prices sparked fears of a global economic slowdown, but the major indexes still managed solid weekly gains.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 201.92 points to 25,989.30 as losses in Caterpillar and Goldman Sachs offset gains from Disney. The S&P 500 dropped 0.9 percent to 2,781.01, led lower by consumer discretionary shares and tech. The Nasdaq Compositelagged, dropping 1.7 percent to 7,406.90 as shares of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet all traded lower.
*****
> The indexes recovered most of their losses late in the day. At its session lows, the Dow was down 308.31 points.
*****
> West Texas Intermediate futures fell 0.8 percent to $60.19 a barrel, after briefly breaking below $60 for the first time since March. They also fell further into bear-market territory, trading more than 20 percent below their 52-week high.
*****
> Disappointing data out of China also dampened sentiment on Wall Street. The country's top auto industry association said sales in China fell 11.7 percent last month, marking the fourth straight monthly decline. The Shanghai Composite fell 1.4 percent overnight. Caterpillar shares dropped 3.4 percent in the U.S. while General Motors' stock fell 2.4 percent.
*****
> ""The overall trend is definitely weakening,"" said Benjamin Lau, chief investment officer of Apriem Advisors. ""You're seeing it in some of the earnings.""
*****
> ""We're seeing more anecdotal evidence that the global economy is weakening from the bottom end to the top end,"" Lau said.
*****
> The weak Chinese economic data come as the U.S. and China engage in a trade spat that has been going on for most of the year. The two countries have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods as the U.S. seeks a better trade deal with China.
*****
> Comments from White House trade advisor Peter Navarro soured optimism about a possible deal between the two countries. ""If there is a deal ‚Äî if and when there is a deal, it will be on President Donald J. Trump's terms. Not Wall Street's terms,"" he said. Navarro's comments come ahead of a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming G-20 summit.
*****
> These sharp losses have rekindled worries about a possible slowdown in the global economy, which come as the Federal Reserve looks to further tighten monetary policy. The Fed on Thursday decided to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged, as was expected, but comments by the U.S. central bank suggested it was on course to continue hiking rates.
*****
> Although a statement released by the institution noted a moderation in business investment, it said the bank still expects ""further gradual increases"" in the prime lending rate. Traders had been on edge last month due to concerns over the Fed's rate hiking path.
*****
> But equities still recorded strong gains for the week, following a big post-midterm elections rally. The S&P 500 and Dow gained 2.8 percent and 2.1 percent for the week, respectively. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, rose 0.7 percent. This week's gains were the biggest for the Dow since the week of March 9, when it rose 3.25 percent.
*****
> The U.S. midterm elections ended with the Democrats taking control of the House and the GOP maintaining a majority in the Senate. This result was widely expected by pollsters and election experts. Under this government make-up, meaning a split Congress and a Republican president, the S&P 500 has averaged a 12 percent gain since 1928, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
*****
> ""We've got this 'yes, but' scenario, meaning things are good right now but a lot can still happen,"" said Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management. ""There's still some turmoil and some volatility keeping investors on the sidelines.""
*****
> On the earnings front, Yelp shares plunged more than 26 percent after releasing its latest quarterly results. Dow-member Disney, meanwhile, rose 1.7 percent on the back of better-than-expected results.

# Typical November Trading: Strength Early & Late

> As of the market‚Äôs close yesterday, DJIA was up 2.07% thus far in November. S&P 500 was higher by 1.61% and NASDAQ was higher by 0.96%. Small-caps, measured by the Russell 2000 were performing the best, up 2.96% over the first four trading days in November. Current gains are consistent with the historical trend of early November strength. However, historically early strength has faded after the fourth trading day. Election results coming in line with expectations has extended strength this year. Mid-month, from around the fifth trading day until the fourteenth trading day, has been choppy. From there until the penultimate trading day of November the market has historically booked solid gains. Recently the last trading day has been prone to more weakness than strength.

# Beyond the Midterm Elections‚Ä¶A Solid Rally Regardless

> Later today the first of the day‚Äôs election results will begin to trickle in and if history is any guide, the results will likely have a minor impact on the market. This is the ‚ÄúSweet Spot‚Äù of the four-year cycle for the market. In the following chart the 30 trading days before and 60 days trading days after the last 17 midterm year elections appear (NASDAQ since 1974). Prior to 1969 the market was closed on Election Day so the close on the day before was used. By 60 trading days after the election (approximately three months), DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ were all higher on average from 6.8% to nearly 10%.

> Digging deeper into the data, the following table shows S&P 500 performance 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months after the midterm elections since 1950. 1- and 3-months after the election S&P 500 was higher 82.4% and 94.1% of the time respectively. By 6-months and 1-year after, S&P 500 was always higher, although gains did slow after 6-months. The years the President‚Äôs party lost control of the House of Representatives are shaded in grey.

# S&P 500 Cumulative A/D Line Tracking Price

> We monitor all sorts of different breadth indicators in order to get a feel for how market internals compare to moves in the major market averages, and one of the most widely followed of these indicators is the S&P 500‚Äôs cumulative A/D line. The cumulative A/D line is simply a running total of the daily net number of stocks in the S&P 500 rising or falling.

> The chart below shows the cumulative A/D line for the S&P 500 (red line) and the index‚Äôs price over the last 12 months. At first glance, it looks like the cumulative A/D line has generally been tracking the price of the index during this period, but if you look closely, there are some key periods that are telling. Looking back at the late January through early Spring period, you can see that while equities sold off sharply in the initial leg lower, breadth held up relatively well. In fact, while the first bounce in February stalled out well short of the prior highs, the cumulative A/D line came close to making a new high. More importantly, though, when the S&P 500 tested the February lows, the cumulative A/D line didn‚Äôt come close to making a new low, and then the rally that followed, it actually made a new high well before the market. This was a key positive divergence at the time and suggested that the S&P 500 would eventually retake its prior highs.

> In the current period leading up to the S&P 500‚Äôs peak right up until now, we haven‚Äôt seen much in the way of divergences in either direction. Both the price and cumulative A/D line of the S&P 500 made new highs on the same day in September, sold off hard, and then in the ensuing rally retraced right around 60% of the high to low decline. Unfortunately, at this point breadth isn‚Äôt saying much good or bad. Looking forward, though, the key things to watch will be how breadth reacts if Friday‚Äôs decline is the beginning of a new leg lower, or what happens if the S&P 500 rebounds and makes a run for new highs.

> If you are a bull, you‚Äôll want to see breadth remain above the recent low on any retest of the lows in price or a new high in breadth ahead of a new high in price. Bears, on the other hand, will want to see breadth accelerate to the downside on any weakness and lag prices on any upside.

Even if they manage to get a 20-30 net margin they will have 24-36 billion dollar in net income. And at their current market cap i don't really see any upside to Netflix stock price.

* Once Netflix‚Äôs earnings growth starts to normalize to roughly 20-30%, we can expect their forward p/e to follow suite and stabilize around 25. That is above the market average and in line with other premium companies. At their current share price of $350, they must earn $6.3 billion in net income or 14.0 per diluted share to achieve a forward p/e of 25. To figure out how they could grow earnings to over $6 billion, I created a bullish simulation.

**Literally Anything that has ever been created for any network on TV that was produced by by either Fox or Disney**

-There are shows that people have no clue fall under these studios that they have control over. For example, How I Met Your Mother aired on cbs for a decade and then went to Netflix for a long while before moving to Hulu. It is, however, owned by Fox. Most people don‚Äôt know that. 

Here‚Äôs a better idea of what is controlled by Fox

https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7jr9es/disney_to_buy_21st_century_fox_assets_for_524/dr9b9yb/


Now I don‚Äôt have a clue what they‚Äôre going to do with Hulu, but that should be enough to raise some apprehension. The content catalog is jaw dropping when you consider everything. 

Everything they produce every year on their wide array of networks can feed into the service. Plus whatever they make for the service. 

No. Netflix is never going to die off. But a valuation down to their actual value is very possible. Probable id say. It‚Äôll take time for all the licensing deals to experience but when they do what comes under control by Disney is staggering. ",

9850,2018-10-22,"You might want to do some research into Disney first.  Unless they plan to gut Hulu, they‚Äôre going to enter with a fragmented service (ESPN+, HULU, Disney streaming Tiers 1,2,3).  That means they have to maintain multiple platforms.  

Not to mention Disney said they won‚Äôt add R rated movies/shows to the service, so there goes a bunch of the Fox assets right there.",

Anotherway to look at it is all people that can speak english at 1.5b  half of them too old or young to care for netflix so possible market of 750m and half of them dont care for netflix content so 375m total possible market but each sub services on average 2 people so total subs at maturity equals 188m.

9853,2018-10-22,"I have done the research and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm convinced that they‚Äôll beat out Betflix in the long term. 

First of all there are no streaming tiers to the Disney thing. It‚Äôs a one stop shop. That tells me you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. Wherever you got that from is straight bullshit and you are peddling misinformation 

2 - splitting Sports is a smart way to go about it. Many people want sports exclusively. 

3 - Hulu is a conglomeration that is owned by multiple entities. So that can‚Äôt go 100% all in. It will continue to act as it always has. It has very minimal presence from classic Disney or Fox IP. It will grow as a producer of original content while also being a provider of skinny bundles of live TV

If people find Hulu to be worth it now, they will find it even more so in the future. All that‚Äôs going to happen with the Disney/Fox merger is the creation of a service that we don‚Äôt have, and a boost to Hulu. Hulu will not lose any content at this point other than a few shows they may want to switch over. That will be more than compensated for with adult content from Fox. ",

You have done no research if you think Disney will be adding even half of what you listed out to their streaming service.  The Disney streaming service is Marvel, Lucasfilm, Disney and Pixar. That‚Äôs it.  Maybe you could help me with a math question:

How many subscribers does Disney need in order to make up for the 300m in annual revenue they get from Netflix for distribution, if they‚Äôre charging less than Netflix does monthly?

I misread the streaming services as it considered Hulu, Disney and ESPN to be the three separate ones.  Nonetheless, Amazon and Netflix only have one streaming service.  Hulu cannibalizes the Disney streaming service.",
9856,2018-10-22,">How many subscribers does Disney need in order to make up for the 300m in annual revenue they get from Netflix for distribution, if they‚Äôre charging less than Netflix does monthly?

Couple million. Or somewhere between 2-3% of Netflix subscribers. At half the price of Netflix, they‚Äôd only need less than 4M subscribers. ",
9857,2018-10-23,That's ~$20 mil out of $300mil,

The first would be Stripe, without a doubt its the best online payment platform and beats square's online offerings quite handily

The second, would be a similar payment option to China's WeChat - imagine without using any card reader and just holding up your phone you send/receive payments. Its a standard practice in most parts of the world and no reason to believe it cant happen in U.S. Hell, google already offers it natively with google pay.

That said, I do think square is in a perfect position to solve both those issues, but if they dont then square has a rough future.

Fedex/DHL/UPS contracts them because their big trucks are not optimal for multiple stops with smaller packages. Larger trucking companies are having problems finding licensed CDL drivers.

RILY liquidates all the brick and mortars that fail, (Gander Mountain, ToysRus, tons of others if you google) This is a bet that more brick and mortars fail. They also buy out subscale investment banks which have good balance sheets, another solid market to roll up.

Buy an index fund mirroring the S&P500, US Small Cap Fund, International stocks fund, and a small % of a tax-free bond fund (municipal). The % allocation across these categories all depends on your risk tolerance, and timeline.

October was a rough ride for U.S. stocks, which despite regaining a portion of the month's losses Wednesday ended as one of the worst months since the financial crisis.

The S&P 500 lost $1.91 trillion in October, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices analyst Howard Silverblatt. Losses were spread widely across industry sectors. October was the worst month for the S&P 500 since September 2011.

""October volatility is legendary, and we're not just talking about the crash in 2008,"" Silverblatt told CNBC. ""October is a much more volatile month than any of the others as far as quick declines go.""

The month kicked off on a rocky note for stocks when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is ""a long way"" from neutral interest rates. Powell said the Fed does not need the policies put in place that pulled the economy out of the last financial crisis. He declared that ""we don't need"" the ""really extremely accommodative low interest rates"" the central bank put in place a decade ago. The Fed is likely to raise the federal funds rate to 3.4 percent before pausing, according to the most recent projections.

Big technology stocks ‚Äî most well-known as FANG: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet ‚Äî were among the hardest hit. Amazon ended the month down 20.2 percent, and Netflix ended down 19.3 percent. Investors fled both after earnings reports. Facebook and Alphabet finished October down 7.7 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively.

* The Dow rises 0.4 percent this week, notching its first weekly gain in four.
* The 30-stock index's gains on Friday are led by Procter & Gamble's biggest one-day surge in a decade.
* Stocks remain down sharply for the month, however, as worries about rates and the global economy persist.
* ""The market is not going to have an immediate recovery; it tends to bounce,"" says Quincy Krosby of Prudential Financial.

*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on Friday on the back of strong earnings from Procter & Gamble as Wall Street tried to regain its footing after a sharp sell-off in the prior session.
*****
> The 30-stock index climbed 64.89 points to 25,444.34, led by a 8.8 percent surge in Procter & Gamble shares, their biggest since Oct. 28, 2008. The Dow also posted its first weekly gain in four, climbing 0.4 percent in that time. Procter surged after reporting better-than-expected earnings. The company said it got a boost from strong beauty-product sales.
*****
> Honeywell and Schlumberger also reported better-than-forecast profits. American Express, PayPal and Skechers all posted on Thursday earnings that topped analyst expectations. Their shares rose 3.8 percent, 9.4 percent and 13.8 percent, respectively.
*****
> The corporate earnings season is off to a strong start. With more than 15 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported, 83 percent have topped analyst expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
> The S&P 500 closed just below the flatline at 2,767.78, however, as declines in health care and consumer discretionary offset a 2.3 percent gain in consumer staples. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 percent to 7,449.03 as Facebook, Amazon and Netflix all pulled back.
*****
> ""The underpinnings of the economy are still in place and earnings are still good,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. ""The market is not going to have an immediate recovery; it tends to bounce.""
*****
> These moves follow a sell-off on in the previous session as investors worried about rising rates, geopolitical tensions and a potential slowdown in the global economy.
*****
> ""The rising rates, rising volatility and the moves in currencies were a wake-up call"" for investors, said Gibson Smith, founder of Smith Capital Investors. ""Earnings should be supportive of stocks,"" but the market is entering a period where it is ""realizing the economy is in stronger footing.""
*****
> On Thursday, the Dow dropped more than 300 points, following a plunge in Chinese equities. History shows that, when stocks plunge in China, the U.S. market is rarely immune as large exporters suffer.
*****
> Overnight, China said its economy grew by 6.5 percent in the third quarter, missing expectations. Chinese equities surged, however, as officials took steps to support the market, and that was helping sentiment in the U.S.
*****
> Stocks are down sharply for the month.The Dow and S&P 500 have fallen more than 3 percent each in October, while the Nasdaq is down more than 7 percent.

# Third-Quarter Earnings Preview: What to Watch

> Third-quarter earnings season effectively kicks off today, and it should be another good one. S&P 500 Index companies are expected to report their ninth consecutive increase in profits and third consecutive quarter with earnings growth of over 20%. We expect these strong earnings gains to be driven mostly by solid economic growth, particularly manufacturing, and tax cuts‚Äîthough higher oil prices should give energy sector profits a nice boost. The interest rate environment has gotten better for financials recently, which also helps.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Another-Quarter-of-20-Earnings-Growth-Likely-on-Tap.jpg?ssl=1))**

> We like looking at company pre-announcements ahead of reporting season to get a sense of where results may come in. At 2.1, the ratio of negative to positive pre-announcements for the third quarter is higher (or more negative) than the second quarter and last year‚Äôs third quarter, but lower than the long-term average of 2.8 (Thomson Reuters‚Äô data since 1995). We interpret this as a positive indicator of upside to S&P 500 earnings estimates, but the potential upside is more modest than in recent quarters.

> Similarly, earnings estimate revisions can tell us something about how results will come in. Third-quarter estimates have held steady since the quarter ended on September 30, but estimates were cut by 1.6% during the quarter. The good news is that the reduction in earnings is lower than the average reduction, suggesting that results will probably exceed estimates, as they typically do.

> So what should investors be watching during earnings season? We highlight these three factors:

> **Profit margin pressure**. In general, companies continue to do an excellent job controlling costs and keeping their profit margins high. But tariffs, (slowly) rising borrowing costs, and budding wage pressures have put the market on notice for potential narrowing of profit margins.

> **Profit growth peak**. We will again hear about peak profit growth this quarter. A peak in earnings growth is very different from an earnings decline, something we see as a long way off. ‚ÄúHistorically, about four years have passed, on average, between an S&P 500 earnings growth peak and the next recession, during which stocks have produced solid gains,‚Äù notes our Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch.

> **China-U.S. trade tensions**. China will be important to watch again this earnings season given tariffs, the ongoing trade dispute, and related slower growth in the Chinese economy, which has pressured its stock market. We also expect to hear a lot about how companies are preparing for additional potential tariffs on Chinese goods, and whether they are seeing business in China drop off.

# The Calendar Is a Bull‚Äôs Best Friend

> ‚ÄúOctober: This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February.‚Äù ‚Äî Mark Twain

> After six straight months of equity gains for the S&P 500 Index and one of the least volatile quarters ever, the historically volatile October is living up to its name. However, earnings continue to be very strong, and we see very little reason to expect a recession over the next 12‚Äì18 months. By no means are investors out of the woods yet, as we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see more weakness and volatility before the midterm elections. Remember, the S&P 500 dropped for nine straight days ahead of the U.S. election in November 2016. Nevertheless, there may be a silver lining for the bulls.

> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the majority of stock gains in midterm years have come late in the year. ‚ÄúMidterm years have tended to be the most volatile out of the four-year presidential cycle, and wouldn‚Äôt you know it, nearly all the gains for the year tended to happen in the final few months,‚Äù explained LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> On average, the S&P 500 actually has been negative year to date ate in early October during a midterm year. Importantly, markets can be jittery ahead of major events like elections. Once the uncertainty is resolved in November, solid fundamentals and strong seasonals could take over for a nice year-end rally.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for this upcoming week? Good trading to everyone in here on this new trading week ahead!

*****

Have a fantastic trading week r/stocks! :)The Stock Market Thread for the trading week beginning October 22nd, 2018",
10181,2018-10-20,"Hmm, looks like EW (Earnings Whispers) might have made a small error with its earnings calendar for this week. Some people on another sub have been pointing out that GE won't be reporting this Thursday (10/25), but rather next Tuesday (10/30).

If someone can confirm that this is absolutely the case I'd greatly appreciate it!

Hope everyone has a great weekend. :)",
10182,2018-10-20,"Robinhood says 10/30

Edit: thinkorswim says that earnings are being released on 10/30 but the earnings conference calls is on 10/25.  GE website says 10/30.",
10183,2018-10-17,Are we having a selloff (lower highs intraday) from investors selling on the strong earnings report? Is this now the time that smart investors would say buy in to the weakness?What to make of NFLX today...,
10184,2018-10-17,"I also think it has something to do more with the overall market sentiment rather than just the stock itself. With the last two weeks we've had, people were looking for ANY sort of good news. With Netflix being part of the so called FANG and one of the leading stocks of the year and being the first Big companies to post earnings I kind of think the reaction was a bit overblown. It was a good ER, and it should have gone up, but I don't know if anyone expected it to stay there.

People are still a little freaked out and perhaps overcautious about last week. It's still a little less gung-ho at the moment.",
10185,2018-10-18,"Short term, I think the stock does okay compared to the tech market (if the technology market falls due to macro-economic pressures, so will they.)

Long term, I see competitors (Apple comes to mind) launching their own services and announcements like that could crush the ridiculous valuations for Netflix. ",
10186,2018-10-17,"This behaviour (big after hours +10% or more, settling throughout the day between 3%-8%) isn't uncommon to historic ""great"" earnings reports, from my perspective. Looking at previous quarters:

Earnings Date -----Change

July	19	2016	-12.97  
Oct	18	2016	18.99  
Jan	19	2017	5.15  
April 18	2017	-3.89  
July	18	2017	21.90  
Oct	17	2017	-3.20  
Jan	23	2018	22.71  
April 17	2018	28.28  
July	17	2018	-21.00 

&#x200B;

Investors are excited by the numbers but also skeptical - 

NFLX was downgraded by a few ""analysts"" before earnings, saying it was going to be a poor showing. 

Subscriber growth was ""inflated"" by including some trial accounts \[3 month free trial\] into the numbers. 

They are taking on a lot of debt to produce content (but, the model seems to be working, with more and more interest from consumers in NFLX originals).

&#x200B;

From my perspective, institutions want to drive the price lower (despite earnings) so they can *BUY MORE*. They've issued press to build skepticism and a small sell-off (ie ""this will be the best quarter they have, sell now, it will never be this high again, etc). Then if/when \[I'd say *when*, but disclosure, I hold NFLX\] it rises back to the highs near 420 (because earnings suggest the growth is justifiable), they will have bought in lower knowing they garnered a greater return.",
10187,2018-10-17,I think stock wants to test $306 soooo bad. Media is also creating a BS narrative about the company not being sustainable. I got in at $276 should be safe down here... ,
10188,2018-10-17,I work on a Netflix show.  The company is not sustainable.,
10189,2018-10-17,Why do you say that? ,
10190,2018-10-17,They are way overpaying for content.  That never ends well.,
10191,2018-10-10,"My portfolio of tech and finance is taking a beating right now.   I'm considering moving to a ""recession prepared"" portfolio by moving to dividend stocks like T, PG, JNJ and DUK and maybe even buying some VXX.

I worry about earnings season, last time we had some stinkers (FB and NFLX) that really hurt the sector.  Investor confidence seems to be running much lower and I suspect any bad news will hurt a lot.

Just wondering what your thoughts are.  Is it time to pull back a bit?Anyone switching out of tech or are you riding this out?",
10192,2018-10-10,Depends on your goals. My goals are very long term (greater than 10 years) so I will be holding. Still quite a bit away from returning to my purchase price though. ,
10193,2018-10-10,"If you think T is recession prepared, I can sell you California for the low price of 5000 dollars",
10194,2018-10-10,"Been buying. Now gonna sit
I suspect the world will continue to use the internet and software ",

I'll definitely ride it out, since I don't need the money right now.  That being said, I ""only"" invested around 2.2K USD into each stock.",

10206,2018-10-10,My goals are very long term as well but I'd also like to mitigate my risks a little bit.  I'd really like to avoid a 2008 situation if possible and there appears to be a lot more risk than reward at the moment IMHO.,

If you do a rough sum of the parts on Amazon the ""overvaluation"" that people always think they see since they read ""The Intelligent Investor"" disappears.",
10220,2018-09-20,"So these  are moving into sector ETFs classified as the ""communications sector"". Disney is also moving from consumer discretionary to communications while amazon stays in consumer discretionary  to make it a much larger portion of that sector. How will this effect trading in the short term. I am expecting a little bump in the telecom stocks because they were already undervalued and they are now in the same etf mix with companies like google and facebook.  I think Home Depot will also benefit from amazon being over 20 percent of the consumer discretionary sector. HD is by far the second largest stock in this sector and if it trades closely with amazon that cant hurt. Apple, Microsoft, and Visa are the main information tech so in theory this group should be less volatile without Netflix, Alphabet, and Facebook, but if there is a rotation out of tech ETFs it will effect these stocks  disproportionately.

I actually think i will buy more T and HD because of these moves. T was in the telecom sector and there was not many other stocks lifting that sector up but now it has some FANG attached to it. Home Depot is now more closely tied to Amazon so I don't mind Home Depot as  my only Consumer discretionary stock now. I might actually trim some my two largest positions AAPLE and V because I have too much and  there are some names lower on the list of technology stocks like ADOBE that will probably not be affected by the changes as much and could still move much higher even if people trade out of this sector etf. Not sure if this has been discussed here before, but are you guys changing your allocation with this in mind?Netflix, Google, T, Facebook and other stocks changing ETFs",

people pay at the movies for drinks and food, the change to have more luxurious seating and alcoholic beverages served, their new service offering is booming.

Also, the picture is not great from a [value perspective](https://www.alphaquery.com/stock/AMC/industry-sector-market-percentiles) \- price to earnings is very high while margins and return on equity are low.

10232,2018-09-26,I used to go to the theaters all the time as a teen. I can easily say I haven‚Äôt been to the theaters in over 2 years. I don‚Äôt even want to know what they charge for alcohol lol ,
10233,2018-09-26,This makes me optimistic that it‚Äôs still early and growing in this new era of theaters. I will say it has translated into good AMC options trades as well.,

10236,2018-09-27,"Oh, definitely. I suppose the wealthier consumers buy more snacks too. Still, hard to believe that my local AMC is still in business.

I went to see the Moore doc last weekend, and it was me and about ten other people. (I actually have their Stubs membership plan, where I can see about 12 movies a month for $22, which is a great deal.)",

10240,2018-09-23,Don‚Äôt expect anything with Disney. It‚Äôs a safe place now that the whole espn storyline has played out. So there‚Äôs some upside to 130. But if the bear market happens you won‚Äôt see that anytime soon. Disney has barely moved in years. Disney upside is not big. It‚Äôs safe ,

10249,2018-09-26,"They could start their buyback program but I think they still are on the hunt for content and an international presence. Whatever money they round up for Sky and Sports networks, I think they make another acquisition. Potentially Discovery Inc. ",
10250,2018-09-23,Yeah I could see a huge partnership on the mobile arena. I've just been accumulating a few shares here and there of Disney over the last year. It at least has a dividend. Disney is going to be a long hold for life most likely.,
10251,2018-09-23,"Even though I disagree with this premise, wouldn‚Äôt you want to invest before the hype inflated the stock price?",

10253,2018-09-23,Ya and the stock more than likely will be higher.,
10254,2018-09-23,Possible. But we‚Äôre in a unpresidented boom. Addidad had help from that too. Disney didn‚Äôt utilize this boom. And if a bear market starts then it will follow the downward trend. Hey ,

What is on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Friday, October 12th, 2018! :)**(10/12) - Friday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News",
10257,2018-09-26,Seems to have consolidated. Short term play to $400?NFLX to $400?,
10258,2018-09-26,Anything to do with the report that the Apple streaming service really won‚Äôt be a competitor to Netflix? ,
10259,2018-09-26,Some day,
10260,2018-09-26,"People are talking a lot about Disney and such, but the truth is there are no fundamentals that will support such a volatile stock going in any specific direction in a short term.  You'd be gambling.",
10261,2018-09-26,I wouldn‚Äôt touch it. Still hasn‚Äôt recovered to its post earnings crash. People saw that it had passed the valuations of Comcast and Disney and all of a sudden realized how bubbly it was. It‚Äôs going to be collared at this range for a while. Another miss and you could see another large drop. ,
10262,2018-09-26,"Possible of course, but right now there isn't much going for it. Disney is getting closer to releasing I thought I heard they already have 1 million subscribers to something they are testing. When that happens it's going hurt Netflix even if it flops. I only invest in it when there's really good news like when they got President Obama and his family to do that 4 year show or something. Plus IQ is taking up some of the potential market they could've had in China so that might dampen their subscriber numbers. ",
10263,2018-09-26,"Eventually, yes.

Netflix still has lots of potential in many areas:

* increasing monthly cost (you'd most likely drop $20 monthly on it if they trickle the price up)
* expenses going down for storing/delivering content
* ads in a non-ad way such as product placement
* interactive stuff - remember DVD-menu games? Imagine that being built on the Netflix app

Not a matter of IF, but a matter of WHEN",
10264,2018-09-26,"Yes, that‚Äôs a given unless we have some wild crisis occur this year with the market. I know there will be another interest rate hike this year so I‚Äôm personally curious how that will affect the market as a whole, Netflix included since I have some shares remaining from 2016. Netflix already hit over $400 a few months back and it‚Äôll steadily incline, in my opinion, which is why I‚Äôm holding on. ",
10265,2018-09-26,"It's overvalued already. NFLX is a simple answer for simple investors. People who aren't doing DD and will flood out as fast as they flooded in if sentiment towards the stock changes. Eventually it will reach a value based on financials and not just hype, same could be said for Tesla and a lot of the stocks discussed on this sub. ",
10266,2018-09-26,"Netflix doesn‚Äôt have a viable models billions in debt needing subscribers to pay hundreds of months to pay it off

The fact is their debt is going to mature and at higher interest rates they‚Äôre going to fall into a debt trap, their services has limited long term viability in my opinion

There‚Äôs a reason cable companies make more money off ads than subscriptions, content is expensive and making new content without that revenue is cost prohibitive, that doesn‚Äôt change just because the world is changing to the internet

I don‚Äôt see a viable way for Netflix to increase its user base 10x or get them to pay 10x more before an alternative streaming service like Disney can offer just as much for the same price while remaining viable as a secondary income stream for the company

Netflix is a stock ripe for failure in the next 5-10 years as the debt matures ",
10267,2018-09-26,"I have no doubt NFLX will reach new ATHs eventually, but remember last quarter's earnings caused the stock to dip hard and it still hasn't really recovered. So with that event so close in the rear view I think people are much more bearish than they were 6 months ago.",
10268,2018-09-29,"No one can deny that [this is an impressive revenue chart](https://www.alphaquery.com/stock/NFLX/fundamentals/quarterly/revenue).  Revenue has been increasing for 25 consecutive quarters!  They are starting to make some real profit too, with net income last quarter of $384 million.  But the stock is certainly very expensive, with P/E and P/B ratios both in the 97+ percentile of the overall market.",
10269,2018-10-16,Nice call. It's at $395 AH right now.,
10270,2018-09-26,Roku has been stepping their game up lately and has gained significant market share so it makes me less bullish on Netflix but it's still a strong hold for me. ,
10271,2018-09-26,Netflix could be replaced by something else in a minute.  There is no substance to the company. It will crash just like all the other dot coms when push comes to shove. ,
10272,2018-09-26,"Why not $800. Its only at a pe of 155 and debt/equity of 185%. Seems cheap to me and little risk.

Surely no competitor can build a website and put content on it? ",
10273,2018-09-26,Netflix is going for $500 be first quarter of 2019.,
10274,2018-09-26,"Netflix is a bad company with bad fundamentals. My 2¬¢, would not invest. ",
10275,2018-09-26,"Needs to get over 374 on volume, ascending triangle but looks bullish to me. With new Month starting monday, I could see it popping big on monday to 385-400",
10276,2018-09-26,"No other streaming service has the reach as Netflix. 

Netflix is NO LONGER just a streaming service but a highly unique content creator. Its like investing in a Studio which has reach in multiple countries

And the quality of original content they have at the moment is 2nd probably only to HBO and it doesn‚Äôt even come close to overall number of subscribers and markets. ( again Emmys were the proof)

Their Upcoming Political shows will be game changers.

Apple is too late and there are too many reports saying the content is very ‚Äò Bland‚Äô

Amazon is 2nd but they are not trying to be 1st anyways.

Disney streaming service is very far off. And even if does come- content is not the same. Yes there is fox content but again. Its atleast a year out if not more. 

Roku is not even in the same category. Its a totally different business model.

All other guys are just trying to play catchup.

The last earning report wasn‚Äôt exactly a disappointed as people keep calling it out. No one can expect crazy growth numbers all the time. Emerging markets take time to grow- especially  when currencies are dropping all over the world right now, so even if people wanted to get it- they cant- and that is NOT because they don‚Äôt like Netflix. The same issues Netflix has- every other competitor will have- cause they are not specific to the platform but to their economies. As someone who watches international content- can safely say it is recruiting top class actors/directors for thier shows in emerging markets as well.

No other content provider has as many region specific shows as Netflix.

Yes, its spending $8 billion just on content- but thats a very good sign. Its changing its image completely as a streaming service AND a studio.



This is def a buy for me- just based on the above factors. 



",
10277,2018-09-26,Also Disney new streaming service in the works. ,
10278,2018-09-26,I can't believe this got negative votes. I believe you. I'm short. ,
10279,2018-09-26,"The 1 million subs is on ESPN+ which launched 5 months ago. Growth is crazy fast. People are seriously doubting Disney in the streaming wars, likely because Netflix is a tech darling (for some reason it‚Äôs considered Tech and not media). It is media masquerading behind the cover as tech. People will figure it out eventually. They have one revenue source that could go up in smoke if competitors land damaging shots on them ",
10280,2018-09-26,You say not a matter of IF yet most of the points you stated are IFs ,
10281,2018-09-26,"Also to add, with Hulu now in Disney‚Äôs hands with 60% ownership after their Fox acquisition, there‚Äôs no telling what competition there will be for Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime amongst the others. Personally, Hulu is incomparable to Netflix when it comes to being able to watch shows as they happen rather than waiting upwards of a year for a season to be released.  You can pay extra to have the ads removed but I don‚Äôt mind them at the moment, but I will if they up them to 2 minutes.. The ‚Äúoriginals‚Äù and their success is what drives and differentiates these streaming companies and it‚Äôs no different than how cable networks have operated (HBO, Cinemax, Showtime, etc.) just reverting to the digital age and these existing networks joining and tacking themselves as a package service (ie HBO to Hulu as an add-on). If they keep doing that, someone‚Äôs going down. Mergers & acquisitions will show who survives.

Amazon prime loses as far as their incompatibility with Googles‚Äôs chrome cast. I am also not aware of any shows that are a ‚Äúmust see‚Äù amazon prime exclusive like I have with Netflix and Hulu. Please chime in if you know of a must see prime show...",
10282,2018-09-26,Roku hasn't produced a single quality original. Netflix pumps out like 8 incredible shows a year,

10286,2018-09-26,"> Disney streaming service is very far off. And even if does come- content is not the same. Yes there is fox content but again.

Disney has an entire catalog (classics/marvel/sw/pirates/all their subsidiaries) that plenty of families or fans are going to subscribed to when properly advertised. ",
10287,2018-09-26,">Netflix is NO LONGER just a streaming service but a highly unique content creator.

And you think it's a highly unique content creator why?  As I view it no different than HBO in terms of being a content creator.

>Their Upcoming Political shows will be game changers.

That's quit the prediction no?

>Disney streaming service is very far off. And even if does come- content is not the same. Yes there is fox content but again. Its atleast a year out if not more.

I think Disney streaming service is one going to happen and two going to happen sooner than you think.  You forget that it has far more than just Fox content as it has its own content that goes back decades as well as Marvel and Star Wars content.  Plus you have ESPN, something Netflix doesn't have.",
10288,2018-09-26,"I‚Äôm not too knowledgeable about this, but what about hulu? Do you think Netflix can compete when lots of content is being pulled off of netflix? ",
10289,2018-09-26,"everything above is factored into the stock price already. That's why its trading 155x earnings. Shit it's trading at 10x annual revenue.  And all that awesome content? it's amortized 

Netflix is awesome. But everyone knows that, you don't have a brilliant idea that no one else has.  Sooner or later I think this has to come back to reality.

10290,2018-09-26,"Disney owns stake in Hulu. They plan to keep Disney streaming pg13 and send rated r content to Hulu. If Disney is smart, they will keep selling Netflix the rights to show some of their movies. Most people are going to buy both. If they are going to buy one, it will be Hulu or Netflix. By selling rights, Disney can make money from their subscription and from Netflix. ",
10291,2018-09-26,"Disney actually makes money, Netflix has yet to make money and are burning through borrowed cash precipitously fast 

If you‚Äôre only paying xx a month no matter where you are in the world, it really not worth it to make multiple movies costing millions each because each one ends up. Being so niche. I don‚Äôt spend 10k so that I can attract one person to spend money at a company for five months worth <$100

I don‚Äôt understand how they‚Äôre sustainable, they‚Äôre going to run out of new subscribers eventually",
10292,2018-09-26,"Because they are turning into a studio is exactly why I'm staying away. Their costs will only continue to increase. If I wanted to buy a studio, I'd rather own Disney.


Plus even third party shows will raise their costs. What percentage of Netflix watching time is people watching The Office? Once the license for that show is up, competitor services will raise the price of the license.


I think the only way they can add revenue to make up for their ever increasing costs is if they add things like merchandise licensing to their IP. But as I mentioned before, if I wanted to get into that business I'd rather own Disney.


It's an amazing service but I'm staying away from the stock.",
10293,2018-09-26,"It‚Äôs trading at 36x book and 170x earnings, you don‚Äôt think huge growth can always happen, AND you label this a buy?

To justify this valuation, it will need to 20x earnings plus whatever annualized return you expect every year until it makes up that 20x deficit. In what world is that a deal, except as a speculative play attempting to profit from rubes?",
10294,2018-09-26,"> Netflix is NO LONGER just a streaming service but a highly unique content creator.

10303,2018-09-26,"No, I‚Äôm 20. Which means If anything I am young enough to have used streaming services for years now. My position on Netflix is that they are very overconfident in their position in the market.  The company seems to think it can just pull whatever films or shows it wants from its lineup, experiment with mandatory advertisements (which had a huge public opinion backlash), and create lackluster content. If you look at Hulu, they have a far better lineup of content, in house produced and otherwise for a more affordable price. The only thing Netflix has over Hulu is the amount of movies available as compared to TV shows. However People often struggle to find films on Netflix because they don‚Äôt have most classics or most good films in general. All they have is a few good movies they managed to license along with a huge gorge of their laughably shitty low budget content. Netflix is a huge household name in the entertainment sector no doubt, and they have a big advantage by being established in a market that is poised for growth when cable tv really starts to die. It‚Äôs just my opinion however that for a new content streaming service to come along and hugely disrupt their market would not be very hard, and that public opinion of Netflix is going to continue to decline in the next few years. Being the successful big household name doesn‚Äôt guarantee long term stability if the company doesn‚Äôt care about adapting and outcompeting.
But that‚Äôs just my 2¬¢. Take it or leave it. ",

10309,2018-09-26,"Hulu is ok service. 

But the whole model is kinda shit tbh.
They not only tell you to pay for the service but also show adds before/mid shows.

That was one of the worst things i hated about it and decided to drop off it.also i was mostly interested in some Comedy central shows which dropped off its service. That was enough for me
( and no fuckin way was i gonna get a Viacom service just to watch those shows) 

Also- i dont know a SINGLE person who prefers Hulu over Netflix.

They either have Netflix + Hulu , or Just Netflix.
Also- Hulu does NOT have any international presence as of date. Mostly because all their TV shows dont probably have rights in other markets.

That in itself should show their power. Netflix being the content creator and Owner- it will never have the antiquated Hollywood operating issues. ( as someone who works in the industry- the entire system is 50 years old with way too many moving parts, netflix doesnt have that issues at all)

Even if viewership on Netflix decreases- dont see anyone cancelling the service

Which means Netflx doesn‚Äôt give a fuck, as long as you keep paying them.

I am a cable cutter, and i( and pretty much everyone out there) will never cut a Netflix out of my streaming services.


Also- Hulu is owned by Disney and Fox- do Disney will just leverage Hulu‚Äôs existing technology. But again. If anyone does get it- it will be an Addition. Not the main service.

Now if Netflix gets into live streaming services. There is no stopping it. $500 is a number it will cross with great ease.


",
10310,2018-09-26,"Yes DO agree. Its overpriced

But it will remain overpriced.

Because the market drives itself on sentiment. Literally NO company is worth its market value out there, that includes AMAZON. 

But based on public sentiment and also how much of a ‚Äò disrupter‚Äô it is.

Facebook is one of the more ‚Äò decently‚Äô priced stocks out there at the moment( and even that is overpriced)

So till the day the market crashes and all companies come to their ‚Äò true‚Äô value, Netflix will continue to remain high. ( until another major disrupter comes along)

10312,2018-09-26,"Monthly subscribers give them more of a reason to create than people paying for individual shows would. Not only do they get to keep all the money (unlike theaters taking a %), but they also get a steady revenue stream that mitigates the risk since a flop doesn't really cost them anything. ",
10313,2018-09-26,if netflix wasn't a studio they would be at the mercy of the content creators. The only way netflix can be profitable in the long run is by making their own content.,
10314,2018-09-26,"You just said every argument every company has today

Amazon was a online Book seller- turned Ecommerce giant  and cloud leader. I am pretty sure people said the same thing about them in 2002 ( oh- no way i am buying amazon- it cannot even compete against Walmart.) beating amazon in the ecommerce game is now very very difficult. Again cause they were one of the first( to do it right)

Or apple- mac turned  music company turned Phone company turned watch company. ( 2007 - Steve Balmer laughed at the existence of iphone- we all know where that went) ( again apple one of the first to do it just right)

The Above 2 companies were disrupters and the only way you need to make money is through disrupters.

Netflix is a massive Disrupter and now( just like amazon and Apple) everyone is just playing catch up. ( similarly Netflix is one of the first to do it just right)

If it was JUST a streaming service. netflix would have been worth 50-100 bucks.

But its a studio that streams..... in international markets. 

Will it remain dominant forever? Probably not.

And if so go and fucking short Netflix. And then we can all watch your money go down. 

Did you even read OPs original question or you just think you need to interject your Disney jerkoff contest? 

The Short term there is not even a question Netflix is King and will remain king for a another few years. No company can dominate all the time, that includes Netflix and ESP DISNEY. 

And a simple 1 year performance shows Disney barely moved from the 100-120 range. Netflix has killed it since then.

Fyi- i was a Disney holder for a long time. And i still think overall assets of Disney is MUCH MUCH more then Netflix ever will be. But that is literally every company out there.

The top performing companies don‚Äôt have a lot of tangible assets and Netflix is playing catch up. Will it remain a $400-$500 company forever. Probably not.
 But Disney will NEVER be a $400/$500 stock and Neither will Netflix ever go back down to $100-$120 disney levels.

But the Sheer subscriber numbers it has is second to none, and it will take Disney YEARS to even take people away from
Netflix

Also- its ENTIRELY possible for both to co exist at the same time. Disney is not going to make any R rated shows movies anytime soon, so that itself is an advantage for Netflix. 

Market caps don‚Äôt mean shit to a normal investor. Its eventually how much one can afford to put money into the market and how quickly that money can grow. And Netflix will grow, and $500 is not entirely a fairy tale number.( lot of other factors are involved in investing and volatility/volume etc is one of them as well- just clarify before you get triggered again) 

So calm down. Your Love for Disney is pretty pathetic.  And pretty rich of you to accuse me of emotional bias when you are portraying that yourself. 

And we are all here to make money, and Disney IS NOT something that can do that at the moment. Its at the minimum 2-3 years out( to get tangible streaming money) and in that time Netflix too will not be just farting around.

Unlike FB GOOG or AMZN, NFLX has always seemed much harder to monopolise. From what I've seen people use it because the trendy films and TV shows are on there.

People don't really ""use"" NFLX, they just open the site/app click the video they want to watch and that's it.

If any other company such as DIS or AMZN begin to release better content I think it's very likely people will begin to switch. People aren't going to stick around on NFLX where there is lower quality content just because of brand loyalty.

I don't like most of the OC, and the OC I do like I would just consider good, not great. 

I'm already on the fence about cancelling it and if Disney comes out with a service that is good and reasonably priced, with NO ADs in the middle of episodes, I'd almost certainly make the switch as I'm a huge fan of the Pixar movies myself haha. 

I also have the theory that any show that releases it's entire season at once, will necessarily never get as big as something like Game of Thrones because there is no chance to hype the show episode to episode. One possible goal in content creation, particularly in TV, is to make the next Game of Thrones and unless they change their strategy, I don't think it's even possible for them to do it even with an extremely high quality show. Stranger Things and House of Cards is about the most you can expect from a Netflix show in my opinion. Definitely no slouches of success, but I wouldn't consider either the type of grand slam as something like Game of Thrones.

10404,2018-08-17,"I disagree with most of what you have written here, and believe there is some false information here. Let me clarify specifically.

> But going down to 200 or even 150 is extremely unrealistic 

This seems to be an example of recency bias, if you consider the average analyst projected EPS for the current year (2.7), then the P/E ratio sits at about 119, a high valuation by most standards. But even when considering the average analyst projected EPS for 2019 (4.36), the forward P/E sits at 73.8. Hypothetically speaking, if NFLX was to drop to 200, its forward P/E (using this same 2019 estimate) would be 45.8, and even at 150, this forward P/E is at 34.4. For a frame a reference, using the average analyst projected EPS of FB for 2019 yields a forward P/E of 20.8, well below the even 50% drop price of 150 for NFLX. I am not saying that P/E is the be-all-end-all of valuation or that FB is the best comparison, but to say that these prices are unrealistic is not accurate. Also keep in mind these ratios are after NFLX has taken \~20% decline from its high in July.

> Netflix's user base has been constantly,  rather exponentially, growing until the last quarter 

The problem, as foreshadowed above, is that Netflix is priced to be the global titan of steaming, with massive growth expectations currently priced into the valuation. If there are any signs that the user growth is slowing, these expectations will not be met, and the share price will be reduced accordingly.

> Disney has pulled out some of its contents from Netflix 

This is a minor list of Disney content which had licenses expire, not the massive content exodus Disney is planning by the end of 2018 into 2019. And while I agree that users will not switch immediately, this industry has relatively low switching costs, as all memberships are electronic and not contract-based. The main point being here that NFLX loses some of their content while a competitor emerges, which could affect the growth of NFLX, an important aspect of their valuation. It is also important to note that the market is very forward-looking, which is why so much growth is priced into NFLX and why Disney pulling content in the future (and launching their own streaming service) is relevant now.

> Netflix has a $140B market cap at the current price, $322.  Putting its share into $200 would make it roughly a $85B market cap. $150 (really?) would make it a $64B. 

Market cap is a relatively abstract concept, especially when only comparing a company to itself. How do we know what the market cap of NFLX should be, or what is high/low for NFLX? This is why other valuation ratios or measures like P/E, PEG, P/B, DDM, etc are used.

> By next year, Disney streaming service will be a new feature. It will have tons of bugs and tons of issues which users will have to experience. 

If the Disney/Fox deal goes through as I read it, Disney will own a controlling stake in Hulu, potentially opening the door for that platform to become their flagship streaming service. Disney also recently launched ESPN+, getting their foot in the door of subscriber-based streaming content, and has had WatchESPN for a few years now. I also believe they acquired the MLB streaming platform of BAMTech, giving them more expertise in the streaming area. These concerns seem to be minor, and the real issue of launching a new streaming service would be marketing and convincing users to switch/add their platform.

> We can also see this same pattern from $TSLA (smaller market cap - around $50B - meaning more volatility expected) which used to be $360 dropped down to $270 (lost about 25%) and bounced back up to $360 again (now 330).  

I strongly disagree with this comparison for several reasons; this is a completely different industry, the company is at a very different stage of its life (and balance sheet), the companies are valued based on different measures (net subscribers added vs cars produced). But more importantly, the TSLA moves were entirely news based: Q2 earnings were not great but guidance said will be sustainably profitable, then Musk announced he was taking the company private at about a 20% premium. Note that he would NOT be moving out of the company, because he currently owns a 20% stake and would maintain ownership and role as CEO if the company goes private. NFLX does not have any similar news driving the price and thus similar claims regarding its future movements should not be made. Then considering that these ""news"" types are vastly different, TSLA ""going private"" vs a NFLX competitor buying intellectual property from a similar competitor, I do not see any similarities worth noting for attempting to project NFLX stock movement from TSLA.",

10406,2018-08-16,"At this point though, don't you think NFLX has its days limited for trading at such high P/E Ratios? I would rather own DIS right now for dividends and potential growth as it removes its and fox cinema content into their own services. Also, DIS owns a 30% stake in Hulu, so infrastructure is available.

10411,2018-08-15,"My preference would be 150. The stock was so overpriced that any bad news can kill its value. Unlike most companies, reinvestment leads to performance later on. But with Netflix there is no endgame. To keep people you need to keep paying for content. It is never ending. People dont want Netflix if new shows and movies are not produced.

I just dont see where they ever stop spending, and the moment they do subscribers will notice.",
10412,2018-08-15,"Well, I'm generally just allergic to P/E ratios of over 30. My favorite long-term holds have a P/E of around 10-20.

Netflix's P/E seems to be about 140, according to Reuters and Yahoo Finance. I'd consider buying if the P/E was closer to 30 or even 40.

Therefore right now I'd settle for a share price of $100, which is a nice round number that creates a P/E of 42.

At a P/E of 140, Netflix needs to sustain these earnings for 140 years before you ""earn"" the price back - however, if their earnings would somehow multiply by 3.5 times overnight, we could get to a P/E of about 40 tomorrow and then the current share price would be more justifiable for myself.",

10416,2018-08-16,"Netflix releases more original content, but HBO Go and Showtime still smoke them in this category. ",
10417,2018-08-16,"It doesn't really matter. What if those shows all miss and a competitor comes out with better shows that year? And this could happen every year forever. And if you look to the movie industry budget often isn't a great indicator of quality.

It's like if Facebook had to come out with a new social network every year, but at the same time a handful of other companies were also putting out their own social networks. Perhaps Facebook would make the best search engine every year, but it's unlikely. I don't see any good reason for people to stick with Netflix if their content quality slips, and I don't see any reason why another company couldn't produce great content.

Another good analogy might be music. You're investing in Taylor Swift because Taylor Swift has a huge production budget and some familiarity. But at some point new artists always come up with more trendy content.

Perhaps people won't switch, perhaps people will pay for multiple stream services. I don't know. But I see a ton of risks which don't seem to be priced in at the current valuation.",

10419,2018-08-16,"Yeah, but with cable you didn't have much choice. You either paid it or had next to nothing to watch. Now you can cut your outgoings by just switching to your favourite streaming service if you wish. I'm not suggesting everyone will, but some will and that's enough of a risk to the current valuation which is based largely on NFLX remaining dominant in the market.

With FB's margins, they are able to eat SPOT's current losses and ensure Spotify's mission of capturing market share. 

Also, the sentiment around FB has been pretty ugly. They have only been in the news when they're being attacked for their use of consumer data. I think an acquisition at this level could reverse sentiment as it would signify FB's aggressive approach to future acquisitions and an attempt to diversify their offering.

GOOG, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, FB are all focused right now on one thing - capturing and retaining consumer's attention. I could see Spotify become an arm for content creation for FB: music, audiobooks, podcasts, news - you name it. Spotify has the clean UI and subscription business model to be a one stop shop for those media.

**- BBRY h**ad a healthy balance sheet, although they had APPLE and then android as new competitors to the smartphone market. BBRY was a dominant position in smart phone market. Rest is history they tanked.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/FGCngSy6/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/FGCngSy6/)

I took long position on FB after the recent drop after earnings. Got in at 177, flipped it at 185. Re-established position at 180.

**- FB** has a healthy balance sheet. No new competitors to social media space. Dominant position in social media space. They tanked because guidance for future was negative, due to increased spending, not necessarily tied to revenue generation.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/xmlr4Q56/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xmlr4Q56/)

Belief

* I believe FB is different from BBRY because I believe this drop is more of a investor over reaction versus a fundamental change to the social media advertising space.
* The reaction is due to the guidance that fb will be spending more money, not necessarily earning less.
* No new players to the market place, unless advertisers are moving towards twitter instead of facebook or instagram. Google still has a play in the advertising space, that is competitive with facebook. Are there new players?
* If consumers are spending less due to lack of disposable income, would advertisers spend more to try and get more customers? OR would advertisers spend less because they're aware they have a decrease in sales due to poor market conditions, so they'd save their advertising budget for a healthier economy?

What do you guys think? what am I missing?



edit- im thinking netflix might be a better comparison to bbry than fb.Aight boys, I need some insight to make sure I'm not reliving my past. BBRY vs FB",
10541,2018-08-17,"Don't think it's a good comparison. Like you'd aid FB has not many competitors, leads the industry and I think the point you're missing is maturity if the industry. FB to social media is the Apple to smartphones. Blackberry was Myspace- early, popular but in a developing industry they couldn't keep up ",
10542,2018-08-17,">	versus a fundamental change to the social media advertising space.

It seems like there *may be* something brewing here (On a societal level). Im noticing more privacy focused initiatives lately, and while I have no idea how effective these groups may be it could be an indicator of shifting public mindsets. 

Id agree we arent near a fundamental change. We‚Äôre in the middle of a ‚Äúdata wild west‚Äù of sorts, and FB is making money. 

However, surely the EU, California and similar will continue to try to legislate the space in new and different ways moving forwards. GDPR might just be the tip of the iceberg ",
10543,2018-08-17,">The reaction is due to the guidance that fb will be spending more money, not necessarily earning less.

This logic doesn‚Äôt make sense. So expenses will grow but earnings won‚Äôt be affected? How? Additionally, the drop was due to an acceleration of expense growth AND declaration of revenue growth.  Clearly short-term bearish hence the huge drop.  However, long-term prospects are better as they haven‚Äôt monetized Instagram Stories.  It just might be awhile as FB has proven to be very patient to monetize.",
10544,2018-08-18,">Expenses can grow without your revenue taking a hit is what I meant. their net earnings will be affected but thats investment into the company infrastructure. so its not really a hit to their revenue.

Okay. But the market cares about the bottom line more than the top line.  Also, as I mentioned already which was said on the call that caused the huge drop, expenses are going to exponentially increase compared to revenue growth in the near term. Not sure if you‚Äôre purposefully ignoring that part at this point.",
10545,2018-08-17,"I think you are right. Blackberry was never as formidable as FB, had far more formidable competitors in Apple and Samsung, etc.

FB is down because smart money doesn't know how profitable ethical/regulated approach to social media will be, and because dumb money blame it for 2016 Trump win/think kids don't use it anymore. 

What matters at this point is how FB sheds the negative PR, and based on how little I have heard from Zucc recently, I say they are doing a great job.",

10551,2018-08-18,"As a FB bagholder,  I have a timeline of around 5 years holding on this stock and don't plan to sell anytime before then so seeing FB stock go down is disappointing but I'm not concerned due to my timeline.

* Why I'm holding FB is they are starting build up sports steaming.  Imagine you can watch events online and chat live with friends, commentators and feel like you're at the game with your OculusGo.   (FB has said they missed out on hardware with not getting into the smartphone game earlier so they're becoming the go to player in VR hardware).
* Their dating app will bring in new users.  Whatsapp is going to utilized by businesses for payments, communication and chatbots.
* IGTV could be the next youtube but also offer performers profile pages and market to increase their online revenue.
* Ad revenue is often based on auctions so companies will inceasingly pay more to fight over minimal social media ad space
* Competitor SNAP, if you can call a company losing money and users a competitor, has lost users globally while FB gained users

FB is beginning to use their revenue to fun new projects and enter new areas of business.  Much like AMZN makes most of their money from the cloud but can use this to fund cash losing ventures.  FB itself said they're going to be reinvesting which is why their margin is decreasing.  They're not making less money, instead they're spending money to make new stuff.

I do think FB stock will flatline for around 2 years or so much like AAPL, GOOGL and AMZN did during their growth/pivot period as FB becomes a mature business and diversifies so if you don't have a longer time from than 2 years you'll probably lose money before it takes off.  I expect it to bottom toward 166 or so and consolidate for 2 years before it begins to climb again on new projects finally come together.  VR, Sports streaming, etc.

10553,2018-08-18,"gdpr?

i dont have a point to counter that. just looking to see if im making an unbiased assessment.

even with societal change though i cant really see a mass exodus from any of the platforms.

I think i read fb has a 50% profit margin and something like 12bil cash. If thats the case, they can even cut staff to find savings.

from my observations, you still have lots of people using fb marketplace. once you have a escrow type fin transact there, and more secure accounts where people are vetted online, id argue itd be a pretty safe way to carry out purchases. which i can see would eat at ebays mkt share where youre dealing with someone without a face or network of people and solely on their past transaction history.

theyve consistently hit 1.5+, over the last couple years so they next quarter of 1.49 doesnt seem likey it should be an issue , especially since guidance for future is in the 1.7+ range.

Do you mean expand the services they offer and extend them to other businesses (b2b revenue)? Because that's what I'm thinking has growth potential for them, but it's just a thought. I don't know what those services are/could be, but that's why I don't work at netflix :D",

Stock market advance was relatively narrow. Now that the leaders are getting hit, the bull can't resume until the old leaders get healthy, or new leaders emerge.

Semiconductors and Financials have not been doing well. They are two of the bigger sectors. Same issue, if these sectors flounder, any market advance is on shaky ground.

It may be instructive to check the SP500 heat map on Finviz. Different time periods can be clicked on to see the relative strength of both sectors and larger stocks. Might be a decent way to see what new leaders might emerge.Last FAANG standing aka Market Leadership",

These shows will generate short term revenue but nothing long term, and that has been how they've raised funds in the past. They can't keep doing that. 65% of their capital is in debt. They are grossly overvalued since they were the first major company to emerge in the online streaming market which has survived.  The disney deal will boost them in the short term but I don't see them surviving much longer at this rate. ",

10633,2018-11-14,"I think if you want to judge Netflix long term, the question comes down to what they had told everyone else.  Could they become HBO before HBO becomes them.

Since they said that, they absolutely have become HBO (look at all their originals), before HBO could become them.  Instead of HBO though, you have CBS and Disney.

This is all to say, the battle comes down to original content.  Can they create enough original content people demand better than other people can.  The scary part here is that the original content is a hard fight to win.  You need to build up tent pole series (Think GoT for HBO, Orange and House of Cards for Netflix, Star Trek for CBS, and all disney for Disney).  In this world, CBS and Disney have an advantage in IP.  HBO has historical ability to do it.  

TLDR.  Netflix next has to compete one things which it doesn't have advantage (content) from the position of 1st.  My personal judgement says its scary and not worth the multiples today.  But if you believe they can create some great IP in the next 3-4 years, I would say they are a buy.",

10686,2018-11-14,This assumes people will only use one streaming service. Having Netflix + Disney + Hulu is still much cheaper than cable and without commercials. ,
10687,2018-11-14,"Company and content are great, but the stock is ahead of itself, imo. Valuation coming down is normal. Growth may be present, just at above-the-market rates of return. As a dad, I have found no better UI, programming and lineup of shows. 

My concept for TV has always been what NETFLIX is and can be, and that is content distribution studios won't do or commit to, with the exception of MAYBE HBO. I'm thinking Blizzard game spin-offs, book spin-offs (Dark Tower series), and really anything with a huge fan-following, needs a long runway of time to play out, using small to medium budget and really any actors not big-name. 

I look at the warchest of content a company like Activision/Blizzard has and if ATVI doesn't go it on their own, then a platform like Netflix would be awesome! Only HBO has come close and other big powerhouses are closing in, but the big networks cannot touch it and are dying off. 

My son and I love the kids shows on NFLX, I can watch it anywhere, there's a ton of shows that are non-Disney, non-Nick, easily located, recommended quickly and a show like Dinotrux spun off into DinoTrux Supercharged. Before that, it was seasonal content, like Halloween and Christmas. Mind you, maybe some of that is big-name network like Disney that will be lost once it is official, however, this can be the future of Netflix, on top of the rights of other companies and more importantly...being Global, something really only DISNEY and maybe HBO have done (to my knowledge). 

As it goes for adult programming, I'm always torn between live sports, HBO, Amazon Prime, etc. I don't find those platforms have a 'sexy' UI that makes it easy to login, get a show and even locate a new show for me. More often, I'm just played out on the whole thing. I do find Prime and HBO's football content great (Hard Knocks, All or Nothing, Ballers) to be enjoyable. For me, it's about core shows then spin-offs. There's too much to watch, so jumping from Streaming service to Streaming service simply for Seinfield, the Office or whatever, isn't worth it. HBO will cash in if they do Game of Throne spinoffs now, keep Westworld rolling, etc. AMC has a potential in American Gods, too. Prime having Thursday night football is awesome, because the graphics are great, they do a wonderful job on delivery and I can go up to my 2 monitor computer at night, work, and keep the game on if I want during the week. That's the benefit to streaming IMO, or put it on a notebook, etc. 

The rest, imo, is filler. I don't get excited about that kind of stuff, so these providers really need some kind of flag pole or main stake franchise or a few to wrap around, then branch-off. As a 38 yo, I wish I had just plunked down some dough on NFLX way back when seeing what they become. Growth is always there when no on expects it because the market then OVER-REACTS to the story it missed and gives it the valuation it has long since deserved. ",

Also, there are still plenty of opportunities for competitors because the entry cost is so low. There are no longer contracts to buy into and you can purchase 3 - 5 different streaming service for the price of cable. They have in no way cornered the market that would make their continued subscriber growth possible. There might be short term opportunity when they enter foreign markets like they are doing in India but will face almost the same competition there that they do here.

10720,2018-11-14,"It‚Äôs possible the announcement caused investors to panic a bit, right?",
10721,2018-11-14,Totally agree. PE of 101.73. That's not for me. If it drops near 50 then maybe.,

10728,2018-11-14,"Yeah the interface sucks because it's centered around getting you to rent and buy movies that you aren't getting through your PREMIUM subscription to prime, but it does have a good selection.",
10729,2018-11-15,"I think it will too, but just on name recognition.

I feel like Hulu is superior to netflix in content right now aside from their originals",
10730,2018-11-15,They remain dominate I wager in the middle age demographic and at that with those single and casually dating.  Netflix doesn't have the family appeal or content like Disney does.  ,
10731,2018-11-14,"I doubt it honestly. You're missing SlingTV, YoutubeTV, all of the specific channel apps, etc. Netflix sells movies/TV shows which isn't a unique product that nobody else can sell. I would imagine that their 'market share' will continue to decrease overtime.  
  
I've had Netflix for a couple years now and I'm too the point where I've seen almost all the types of movies/shows I'm interested in. They don't really upload new shows/movies that quick and they seem to only have good movies available for a couple months. If they actually had all of their movies availble including the ones that are used for rentals I think Netflix would be the best app.",
10732,2018-11-14,"> Use only one service

It says that *some* ppl will sacrifice Netflix to use a different service.

Not an all or nothing prospect...

Just recognizing with more competition, Netflix may find it harder to hold on to / gain new subs as our entertainment budgets get pulled in multiple directions.
",
10733,2018-11-14,"Exactly. I actually listened in on the Disney earnings call a week or two ago, as I am very interested in Disney+.

It sounds like Iger wants to build a service that wouldn't REPLACE existing streaming services (especially since Disney owns 60% of Hulu), but they want to build something that would supplement the current streaming services. Iger even said they would have a discounted price to reflect the initial limited content that would be on Disney+ when compared to the competition.

Still not sure what Netflix is worth, as growth will definitely be slowing long-term. I think I'd buy around the $220 range.",
10734,2018-11-14,Seems pretty easy to just have 1 plan but switch plans and binge the shows for a month on a particular service.,
10735,2018-11-14,And with pretty primo content across the 3 platforms. Seinfeld alone is worth a Hulu subscription!,
10736,2018-11-14,NFLX has a valuation waaaay over what it deserves.  Growth stocks will overshoot a lot of the time.  Look how long MSFT was dead money.  NFLX won‚Äôt grow into its current valuation for a decade IMO.,
10737,2018-11-14,"There has not been a serious competitor aside from maybe Amazon. With the Disney service, that will be the *only* avenue consumers can view Disney content, and Disney owns a huge amount of content, specially with the pending Fox transaction. It may not cause NFLX to lose customers en mass, but it could slow growth, especially for young families who's children will want to watch Disney movies. ",
10738,2018-11-14,"It doesn't look like they are losing customers en mass. The biggest risk is that they will need to spend lots of money on content to keep subscribers as they lose third party content. They must keep growing their subscriber base to keep up, but even then they will keep burning cash. ",
10739,2018-11-14,Lol....oh you‚Äôre right. I forgot blockbuster also had the content portfolio that Disney has! Totally the same thing. Good comparison ,
10740,2018-11-15,"As was NFLX until a few years ago. I still think people are underestimating the rise in competition. NFLX is moving from a tech company to more of a media company. At some point, it won't be priced as a fast growing tech company. ",
10741,2018-11-14,"The only network that has ads on Hulu for the ad free option is about 6 ABC shows, mainly Shonda Rhines shows. They were contractually obligated to show ads before the no ads option came to existence. Once the contract is up, everything will be ad free ",
10742,2018-11-14,"Maybe not, but I think it's a bigger deal than you think it will be. ",
10743,2018-11-14,There's definitely some garbage on Netflix but come on $12 a month for all that content? I probably used to spend 15x that a month on cable and dvd's back in the day. ,
10744,2018-11-14,"‚ÄúThose markets‚Äù won‚Äôt come as easily. Not by a long shot. The media was hyping Netflix‚Äôs growth in India...in reality all services are getting absolutely railed due to Fox‚Äôs Hotstar service (soon to be Disney‚Äôs). Netflix is in like 5th place and their active user count is virtually negligible compared to Hotstar.

10749,2018-11-14,Can they sustain 100x earnings forever or will they eventually fall to 25x?,
10750,2018-11-14,If Time Warner wraps DC/HBO/Warner Bros into a single service...Disney and Hulu‚Äôs bundle + Time Warner‚Äôs service would kill Netflix. ,
10751,2018-11-14,"Its hard to say.  Its not clear that HBO can be scaled up.  If you give HBO 4x the budget, it seems unlikely it can find 3 more GoT.

HBO has shown that it can consistently have 1 to 2 must see highly talked about shows going on (off top of head, I think True detective season 1, sopranos, sex and the city, etc etc ) at any given time.  If you 4x the budget, do you think they can steadily have 4 to 8 of those types of shows at one time?  

My personal opinion is no they can't, so I wouldn't bet on HBO to grow that big.  On the flip side, I also don't think NFLX can have 4 to 8 at that level and so I would expect them to drop.

Of course I didn't ride them up (At the time, I chose to go with AAPL instead) so what do I know.",
10752,2018-11-14,"That is true.  Though their market cap is 125 or so today.  HBO is 30 or so (based on quick google search). 

If I think of it that way.  Is netflix's content creation 4 times better than HBO's?

I don't think any of those shows hit at the level of Game of Thrones or even Westworld.

Though I'm not trying to convince anyone anything.  I think individuals can make a judgement on Netflix based on their content creation capabilities.",
10753,2018-11-14,"Just wanted to point out that Netflix doesnt actually own many of the series you mentioned, they just pay to stream them.",
10754,2018-11-14,Wait for it to come down to $112 level. ,
10755,2018-11-14,"at least for now it doesn't really matter what new content Disney, every parent in america will pick up the streaming service for all the old stuff. It's almost like skyrim where just porting snow white to whatever new tech will allow it to sell all over again.",
10756,2018-11-14,"Here's what I wonder about.  At present people are assuming the current business environment will persist. 

My question is how does Netflix survive or change in a world where the telco/mso charges each of their subscribers a flat fee for access to a streaming bundle. 

We have examples of this today, e.g. t-mobile is already doing zero rating content services with their ""Binge on"" feature.  They're not collecting subscriptions from their subscribers yet, but when 5G rolls, will they start subscription bundles? Or, how hard, or complex would it be for Comcast, or at&t to offer a ~$20 bundle that aggregates content they already own (NBCU + Hulu for Comcast, and TW, incls HBO, for at&t) with other content from Netflix + Disney?

Under this kind of scenario wouldn't netflix would be more comparable to a ~discovery networks?

*EDIT*

By discovery networks I meant NASDAQ:DISCA

10757,2018-11-14,"I would beg to differ. Netflix does have original shows and many of them are based on marvel heroes which disney is taking away from them. House of cards is probably not gonna last too much longer either since the  main cast is gone. The only other show i can see ppl would like is stranger things which they seem to be taking too long to produce.   
Disney on the other hand has way too much IP and cash in hand to produce shows. They are not selling bonds like netflix to produce cash. Disney has all the content for kids as well while netflix doesn't. Lastly disney will be pricing their service lower than netflix.   


Given all these point, I just cant think of a reason to keep netflix.",

10789,2018-11-14,"PE is an output, not a driver of anything...and yes they can.  You can even sustain negative earnings for a very long time, making your PE infinite.  Reason is because earnings are not cash flow.  Earnings (net income after D&A, interest and taxes) is used for PE measures and is an accounting artifact, used for calculating corporate tax.  This is something commonly managed down in order to lower the tax bill.  Manage earnings down, you lower taxes but raise your PE.  Look at EBITDA.  Better measure of solvency...that is what banks and many professional investors commonly use.

Those shows account for maybe 10 hours of viewing each per season and they haven't even been able to produce them at a rate of one season per year. So from a volume watched standpoint I think Netflix is far and away 4 times better than HBO. As for weighing the quality of each person's two favorite Netflix shows vs. HBO, that's going to be difficult. Personally, I love GoT and WW and they definitely edge out my favorite two Netflix shows, but not by a lot.

‚ÄúIn India, to be a mass product you also have to be in 20 languages and also do certain types of content,‚Äù Hastings said in an interview. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre targeting well-off people comfortable with English-language entertainment.‚Äù",
10910,2018-11-15,"With NFLX making up about 20% of my portfolio, I can't justify buying more, but I can't justify selling it, either. I think it will continue to grow. Even if slowly, I want to be along for the ride. Netflix keeps eating up new markets and has become ubiquitous in the US. 

For me it was one of those ""find a company whose product you like and buy their stock"" type of investments (I want to say this was back in 2011). While I'm not wild about all (or even most of) their new original content, they have been producing some shows I really like (Altered Carbon, Big Mouth, Dark, Stranger Things). 

And like him or hate him, Reed Hastings seems to know what he's doing. ",
10911,2018-11-15,if you own so much why don‚Äôt you just sell covered calls at a ridiculously high strike that even if i did get exercised you would be comfortable selling after getting that high of a swing and if doesn‚Äôt hit the strike you just collect premium?,
10912,2018-11-15,">Not a terrible idea, but I really don't know what I'd put the money into (I'm already like 30% cash) and it's been a wild ride so far so I kind of just like letting it ride.

10913,2018-11-15,üòÇüòÇ shit and really i think selling covered calls is really a good idea in utilizing this irrational market when you want to remain in stocks you already own. Collecting premiums is really just a way to slowly pull in gains. My recent strategy is i‚Äôve been straddling DIA and SPY with all this big market information occurring and when the swing goes quickly one way i just close out that end of the position for the gain. Sometimes if i buy the strikes close enough and the Dow bounces back i can end up profiting from both legs of the strategy,
10914,2018-11-15,"You're probably right, but I've had these shares for so long. They're practically family. Hell, like I was saying, they even reproduced while I had them. I actually had 200 shares at one point... sold half of them for like a 200% profit (so much regret) and then those 100 remaining split 1:7 a few years later. I can't risk letting them go now. If they can recapture their magic, they'll help me retire early.

10921,2018-10-08,"My bet is on the health insurance sector. 

United health. Well point, Kaiser, Cigna, Humana, Aetna, blue Cross blue shield....etc.

Either Amazon will buy one or more do that Bezos can have a side project when he also buys a major retail pharmacy....or the other thing that will happen will be a major exposure of the fact that insurance companies are the real reason most baby boomers are in debt and unable to retire with solvency. That will trigger a series of expos√©s and deep dives into health insurance billing practices, the corruption and opaqueness of it all, and also their horrible reimbursement rates to all health care providers/hospitals/pharmacies. The expose will lead to the simple fact that insurance companies write the rules for complex billing practices, and an understanding as to why everyone in American health care basically bankrupts the consumer, all so that the various companies involved can continue to overcharge each other, while the consumer is left holding the bag. The intense outrage from this (apparently secret) systemic issue will lead to a public outcry unlike any we've seen before, and the only thing stoking the flames of that fire are the rage of the baby boomers. Why is that fire hotter than all others? Because baby boomers never die, and will continue to use health care services, and they will be so outrages about going into debt. 

Anyway..That's kind of far fetched. Regardless, the health insurance sector has been building a house of cards for a long time, and while everyone screws everyone else over, the general public is still not aware that the insurance companies write the rules to the game. When the public realizes that, game over. Thats my theory.

It might take more than 5 years to realize though. ",

Every time the market goes up more than standard valuation increases, the market becomes out of balance and increases potential to die. Spend $100 on a $1 stock, you get 100 shares of demand. Spend $100 on that stock at $10, you get 10 shares of demand. Demand of shares naturally reduces when shares go up too fast. When market goes up 10x, you only need 1/10 of the buyers to sell to get it to reverse, because the same amount of demand money only buys 1/10 the shares. Over-buying makes the bull market very fragile. ",

Just wanted to be clear because it seems that you might think if Disney buys Hulu they will put all their content on Hulu, but that isn‚Äôt the case.

I think Disney is the best content creators in the world and have two of the biggest franchises (Star Wars and Marvel).

Each month over 1k gets stashed into my 401k. I look at each fund and see what stocks they purchase. Usually they have around 5. The one I chose had facebook,apple,amazon, and like 2 more. Not too enthusiastic about apple but the other 4 were legit. Now I have to be employes with the company for 5 years to qualify for the match but over 5 years I will have at least 50k with the matchs depending how the market moves overall. Basically a free 25k to play the market. After 5 if I move then I'll roll over to IRA pick the exact stocks I want. There are a few different IRA's. They have tax benefits but the best thing you can to is maximize your match with your employer.

don't forget 10k is still in VOO so it's really 15k to play with. even if all 15k is gone (extremely unlikely) you still have your VOO. i like it better than all 25k in shares.

Buying the shares outright would be much higher profit potential from VOO, with much lower risk than your options plays. Saying that options are low risk should be illegal. Especially just buying calls outright.

Saying if you think options are too risky you should put it in savings is like saying if you think putting your life savings in black is too risky, you shouldn't be in a casino, when you could be playing blackjack with $10 hands. There are other ways to gamble/invest where you don't risk losing it all in one bad turn of the cards.

Thank you so much.Why biotechnology stocks?",
11235,2018-09-08,"Biotech is an industry poised for disruptive game changing therapies that are really starting to come to light and many speculate the next few decades will be a golden age for sector.


Stem cell therapies, gene-editing (CRISPR) tech, gene-silencing tech (RNAI), and other bleeding edge tech, first discovered maybe 2 decades ago, have been working out kinks and starting to see some remarkable results. Getting these through the FDA is a long, long, arduous and expensive process. But finally, we are seeing light at the end of the tunnel. Diseases that have long since been written off as having no cure or only mediocre therapies have legitimate, real potential for functional cures.


People like biotech for a few other reasons:

-The FDA has a very standardized drug application and phasing system that is relatively easy to follow. The game is to extrapolate what you are seeing in early phases to make educated bets on drugs or therapies that will make it through and have an impact in the industry. Not many drugs make it through all the way to phase 3 - so it can be quite risky, but that means big reward as well.

-You can't put a pricetag on health. Imagine if you had cancer, were blind, losing a limb, etc - How much would you pay to prevent that?

-Boomers are in the later stages of life now and will spend increasingly more on healthcare than anything we've seen in this country to date. 


I personally feel strongly about the next coming successes of the RNAI field being ripe as hell. Take a look at ARWR and the HepB therapy in P1/2 making big waves. I will probably slowly move into CRISPR tech in 3-5 years - this is a more complicated therapy then RNAI and believe it will take a bit more time to work out the last kinks.

#**DISCUSS!**

What is on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Thursday, November 8th, 2018! :)**(11/8) - Thursday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News",
11262,2018-08-19,Netflix has dropped over 100 dollars in value in the last month and it it looks like it's going to keep dropping. I had purchased it at around 260 a share and I am debating whether or not to sell it now and maybe buy it when it starts to increase in value again. Should I hold it or sell it?Should I sell NFLX?,
11263,2018-08-19,"Buy low, sell high",
11264,2018-08-19,"Unless you absolutely need the money, now would not be an ideal time to sell ",
11265,2018-08-19,"As another user once said ""You will never lose money by securing profits."" In my personal opinion (I could be wrong), I thought that Netflix was overvalued when it was around $400, and even after it dropped in July to around $350. I think something Netflix will struggle in the upcoming quarters will be increased competition as others have commented as well as the lack of quality content produced by Netflix itself. I don't think I am the only one that shares this sentiment, but I think something that could be improved by Netflix is their interface/platform. Maybe it is just me, but too many times in my friend groups have I heard that finding movies/films/shows on Netflix that they like is really difficult, and they usually end up rewatching ""Friends"".",
11266,2018-08-19,"Sell to protect your gains, Netflix has hit a plateau in terms of growth, its valuation was priced for perfection based on its multiples. Competitions are only going to become more intense even within the US market with Disney-Fox, AT&T, Google, Amazon & Roku etc. all want a piece of the cake.",
11267,2018-08-19,"Selling now would be the equivalent of selling a low to me. I don‚Äôt believe all the bears out there, NFLX is still a strong company and they‚Äôre growing quickly while continuing to pump out quality content. If it ever needs more cash flow, it can raise its prices by just $1 and still make billions more. I‚Äôm no analyst, but I‚Äôd hold on as it‚Äôs bound to climb back up eventually.",
11268,2018-08-19,"If you're trying to time the market so you can make more money,  selling now gives you the opportunity to buy back in later...
But if you're just trying to protect your money,  you could buy a protective put, (kind of like insurance) if the price goes below your put you could exercise. ",
11269,2018-08-19,"Hold, from my perspective.

It's down because subscriber growth wasn't *great* (5.1m instead of est. 6.3m, which is a big miss, but WallSt was content with Q2 of the prior year, 5.2m). Most of the growth was internationally, which isn't as saturated as the US market.

Revenue was 30m less than expected (3.91b instead of est. 3.94b) but the difference is 1%. To me, that's not a big deal.

They still beat on earnings, 6.25% surprise (¬¢85 instead of est. ¬¢79.4).

Most of this is classic, ""Wall St not happy ENOUGH."" ",
11270,2018-08-20,"always, always partial sell and partial buy. 

I sold about 35% of my total netflix share last week and invested in other stocks. 

In that way, if it goes back up or if it goes down more, the risk is minimised to a certain extent. ",
11271,2018-08-19,"I thought about buying puts a week ago. I think I should have done so, but I am not sure if the price is gonna further go down.",
11272,2018-08-19,Price elasticity ,
11273,2018-08-19,"There's only negative sentiment right now after their disastrous earnings. People were used to massive earnings beats and record subscription numbers, especially given how overvalued earnings wise Netflix is (145 P/E??). Also, there is a lot of negative consumer reaction to the ads that Netflix is slowly rolling out. This could follow a snapchat like trend in which users drop because of unwanted redesigns.

I would sell to lock in profits, it has been only going down the last few weeks. ",
11274,2018-08-20,I got in around the same time as you and I sold at like 370 wish I sold earlier. Just waiting for it to hit the 200s again to maybe get back in.,
11275,2018-08-20,Yes ,
11276,2018-08-19,"It went up, it‚Äôs going down now, and the market will correct and go back up. If anything, I‚Äôd consider buying more ",
11277,2018-08-19,"So many people are complaning lately about netflix trying to incorporate adds and whatnot to paying customer, creating a lot of negative impact on their image. I definetly wouldn't buy more. ",
11278,2018-08-19,Selllllll,
11279,2018-08-19,I prefer to trade sober. ,
11280,2018-08-20,"I definitely think Netflix is a sell right now. It's valuation was never realistic, it was as if people believed it would forever be the be all end all source of TV-shows and films. Truth is shows have been disappearing left and right lately (30 Rock, It‚Äôs always sunny in Philadelphia, Archer, Futurama, Firefly, Family Guy, American Dad just to name a few). Any and all Disney, Pixar, Marvel and LucasFilm films will also disappear soon enough. Add in the fact that Netflix original shows are complete crap and you've got a recipe for revenue decay. Even assuming it doesn't loose revenue I don't see their fundamentals supporting more than a 30-40 dollar valuation.

There are going to be a lot of bagholder on this one.",
11281,2018-08-20,Maybe the best days are past them already....,
11282,2018-08-19,You are so wrong in that confident forecast. Netflix can and will hit 200-250m subscribers in the coming years. Plenty of growth ahead. ,
11283,2018-08-19,I get the joke but this made me think about taking realistic losses instead of holding until the company flops.,
11284,2018-08-19,"Between all the Disney content they will lose and the ads (only during binging for now) I can see subscriber growth being negatively impacted. That being said, if it isn't impacted significantly I can see the addition of ads being a positive becasue of the revenue it will bring in.",
11285,2018-10-17,"

11286,2018-10-29,"Have always been a buy and hold type but after suffering through this October, im re-thinking my strategy.

&#x200B;

Bought into AMD at 10, shot up to 33 and now down at 16

Bought into AMZN at 900, shot up to 2K and now down to 1500

Bought into NFLX at 330, shut up to 400 and now down to 280.

&#x200B;

 I could go on and on. 

&#x200B;

So is the lesson to always secure profits even if its at the risk of paying short term gains?

&#x200B;

 What lessons have you guys learned this month?Lessons learned from October decline",
11287,2018-10-29,The lesson I learned this month is to keep some of the portfolio in cash for buying opportunities.  ,
11288,2018-10-29,"I also bought amd but at 20 and am sad.

I found out that just because a company is profitable that it can still lose all of the market value of its stocks (DRUS) after a reverse split.

I learned that with any Canadian minerals company it'll slowly lose value until they get their next deal, then you sell and gtfo (PCY)

I learned that an ETF based on the s&p can lose value much faster than the index (SPHD).

I had a crap month but am still investing, buying a grand of Weyerhaeuser today. (I'm a noob investor)",
11289,2018-10-29,so what im seeing is you're mostly up over a relatively short time? ,
11290,2018-10-30,"I learned that markets can go down as well as up.  Like, wtf, who thought that was a good idea?",
11291,2018-11-03,"I had a good month. The volatility helped me. I think I made 20 trades a few Wednesday‚Äôs ago. The volatility made the premium better. 

Week to week I evolve. A little bit. 

I have been doing Strangles and doing good. 45-30 days out. If I am up $100, I close it and get it again at new numbers. 

I like October. It is a good month ",
11292,2018-10-29,"I keep seeing buying opportunities, then use up all my cash, then see more and get sad lol.",
11293,2018-10-29,"I did this and only did because I was looking to buy more, but then got cheap feeling everything was so expensive, now's very tempting to make moves. ",

11316,2018-08-23,You've got some pretty good stocks already IMO. I'm not confident on Netflix. I think dominos is good but it may be a little high atm. Maybe wait for a pullback?

If you want to buy Netflix I would actually recommend Facebook instead. I believe Facebook is trading at more of a discount.

If you're looking ultra long and don't mind losing a little near term, look at JD or GE. Both have short term risks but have huge potential in the ultra long term.",

All of the businesses above do completely different things. Amazon is a retailer. Netflix is a video entertainment provider. Google is an information search engine. Facebook is a social media platform.  None of these companies are in the same industry. 

The only thing these companies have in common is that you do business with them online, as opposed to in person. 

It‚Äôs like if you told someone 20 years ago that investing in Walmart, Blockbuster Video and Intel is a bad move because they all operate in brick buildings lol. ",

11343,2018-08-23,"Actually facebook and google both make profit by selling user data.

11345,2018-08-23,Not an option for me very tight regulations in South Africa  and took many months just to find a platform to do it myself  without having to suck up to brokers and institutions.

11347,2018-08-23,"> I think amazon and netflix will do the same,

Amazon is already doing that as well, if you are considering targeted ads as selling user data. I believe selling ads brought in like $1B in revenue for Amazon in the last quarter.",
11348,2018-08-23,"S&P is not an ETF, it is an index, $SPY is the ETF that tracks the S&P index.",

But maybe the numbers weren't so good and it was company specific. Any thoughts. How did u rate thier q3 earnings. What does NFLX say about market.,
11390,2018-10-28,"If a stock can't go up on good news, down is the most likely course. The brief rally then fade is trouble. One interpretation is that short term traders popped the stock higher, and the big boys (pension funds, mutual funds) sold into strength.",
11391,2018-10-28,"NFLX has burned $27 billion on content acquisition since 2016 and have only earned $32.2 in revenue. They have spent $8.9 billion during that same time on Marketing, Technology and development, and General / administration. They are GAAP profitable because they have been able to capitalize their content acquisition, meaning that they pay $3.0 billion today for content that they will count as an expense over the next four years years. In Q3, they only realized a $1.9 billion expense attributable to content paid for in previous periods.

There should be some concern that they will be required to pour more and more cash into content acquisition and will not be able to do so with a positive operating cash flow. In Q3 2018, they burned $690 million for operations. That's not terrible for a high-growth company, but if this number keeps moving in the wrong direction, it starts to look like they're financing content in a way that isn't sustainable. The end result could be that Netflix will face bankruptcy once their debt becomes unserviceable under the burden of content acquisition cash outflows.

The impact of this borrowing today is reflected in a 79% increase in Y-o-Y interest expense as a portion of revenue Q3 2018 over Q3 2017. Again, not a big deal right now, but equity values are very sensitive to long-term expectations and 80% Y-o-Y growth in this category is not good. What is 3% now will balloon to almost 20% in 5 years at that rate.

If you look at competitor streaming services, most others services either use a different business model (like Google's YouTube), or have other business lines like NBC, Comcast, and Amazon that benefit from streaming subscribers. It could be that they're subsidizing streaming at a loss to benefit the larger customer relationship. If that's the case, stand-alone streaming may not be a profitable venture over the long-term.

There is a compelling case to be made that Netflix will be belly up inside of 10 years or sooner, particularly if capital markets tighten up as the Federal reserve tightens the money supply.",
11392,2018-10-27,"It looks like the bears are trying to bring the market down. They are really using anything to justify selling so even though NFLX and many other companies had good earnings they ended down either the same day or in the days following the report.

I don‚Äôt see the bear case, I understand China might be an issue, increasing rates and midterm elections are something to pay attention to.  I just don‚Äôt see the case for a recession.  GDP on Friday beat estimates which in my eyes is ANOTHER positive indicator that we will not be entering a recession.",
11393,2018-10-28,"There's a reason they capitalize their contact costs over 4 years, though. They amortize it based on the value over time, which is driven by views. In short, people generally watch the content over a 4 year period so they amortize over 4 years.

I guess what I'm saying is, it's not fair to criticize them for capitalizing as if they are hiding something. They aren't hiding anything. Their revenues in the current period should only be compared to the costs amortized, because the content will continue to benefit even beyond this period. It's not fair to compare their revenues (which continue to rise, mind you) to actual cash spent on content because that doesn't really make any sense when the content will be useful for years. ",
11394,2018-10-28,I heard the same arguments 3 years ago and those bears got smoked. I'm agnostic. My general rule is you short crappy companies that are disappointing not good companies that are overvalued. The cash burn is a concern but NFLX does have access to capital. You can argue for how long but that's another story. I'm more interested in what the bulls have to say about thier recent quarter vs the short thesis. ,
11395,2018-10-27,Ah I disagree a bit. A lot of companies are missing big and getting killed. I am not calling for a recession but earnings estimates probably need to come down. ,

We had a correction that I think was over done. We are looking at stocks that are down over 10% based on little to no bad news. AMZN is down something like 20% from the highs. If there is no fundamental change (besides poor guidance and the one or two numbers they missed) you wouldn‚Äôt want to buy them at the discount?

FANG got wrecked this year - so far.

Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google parent Alphabet plummeted during 2018, compounding weakness that has plagued the broader tech space.

At least one of those names could have hit a bottom, according to Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak.

""The stock that I think could be compelling down here is Facebook,"" Maley said on CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Thursday. ""It's not a crowded trade any more. It's been washed out.""

Facebook is the only stock of the group negative for the year. It has dropped 10 percent in 2018, the bulk of those losses sustained after its notorious $120 billion drop in market cap in late July after its worrisome second-quarter earnings statement.

While Maley says the fundamentals in other FANG stocks might be more constructive, their steep run-up means they're more vulnerable to a pullback than Facebook.

""If the market begins to roll over, you're actually going to see the Googles and the Netflixes, some of that fast money, the momentum money, start to sell in a little bit of a panic move, but that money has already disappeared from Facebook,"" said Maley.

Do you think the sell-off is over in the FANNG stocks?

Are you personally buying FAANG stocks at these current prices?Cumulative return for FAANG stocks in 2018",
11407,2018-11-25,"S&p500 was -2% ytd. Google -4%, fb -27%, but the rest outperformed s&p 500. The basket outperformed I'm pretty sure. Hardly getting wrecked, imo.

11408,2018-11-25,"Facebook is in for a bumpy ride with everything they have going with the EU, likely will be some investigations in the US as well. As long as Zuckerberg is steering the ship, I think there's going to be a perpetual shadow of doubt.",

IBM had seen revenue rise year-over-year for three straight quarters after a nearly six-year stretch of revenue declines. IBM also saw its share of revenue from its faster growing businesses like cloud computing fall to less than 50 percent of total revenue.

Additionally, Deutsche Bank upgraded United, as well as rivals Delta Air Lines and American Airlines after the carriers recaptured a larger amount of their increased fuel expense than analysts had anticipated.

What is on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Wednesday, October 17th, 2018! :)**(10/17) - Wednesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News",
11416,2018-10-17,Bull Traps Are Real,
11417,2018-10-01,"Here is a quote from an interview with Sun Microsystems CEO, Scott McNeely, that he gave after the peak of the DotCom mania:

>At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don‚Äôt need any transparency. You don‚Äôt need any footnotes. What were you thinking?

Currently there are more stocks trading above x10 revenue then there was at the top of the Nasdaq just before the Dotcom crash.

Sun Microsystems saw its stock price drop by over 90 percent after the correction.

Some of the stocks that are trading at these incredible evaluations are what many consider their shining stars right now.  Stocks like Facebook, Visa, Mastercard, Nvidia and Netflix.  Obviously you can add many more to this list since there's dozens of stocks trading at these levels right now.

After reading a few articles about current evaluations I thought I'd share some of this here and see what kind of response I got from this community.  I know it's hard to time the market but are a lot of people setting themselves up for some extreme disappointment if things return to fair value?Is this quote from the past warning us of irrational exuberance today?",
11418,2018-10-01,"Unlike the DotCom era companies, the companies trading at such valuations are ones that have diverse portfolios of products and services, are unmatched by competitors or have competitors that appeal to a different market, and have tons of future potential. Why I agree there is some irrational exuberance and stocks are overpriced, they‚Äôre not running running the same risks as DotCom era companies because of how they‚Äôre ran.",
11419,2018-10-01,"We‚Äôve hit a permanently high plateau. /s 

I see people comparing Amazon to companies like Pets.com. That‚Äôs apples to oranges. Compare Amazon to Cisco and it‚Äôs pretty clear where we are today. 

This isn‚Äôt shocking to me. This is the Gen Xers taking the Millenials to the cleaners, just like the Boomers took the Gen Xers to the cleaners years ago. ",
11420,2018-10-01,"The dot com companies couldn't make profits and went under.  That's why their stocks went to 0.

Sun Microsystems did not do business as efficiently as companies today.  For instance, Amazon nowadays does not pay taxes.  Facebook could have had marginal expenses (see 85.2% gross margin), and they've got 1.5 billion followers around the world, more than Jesus Christ.",
11421,2018-10-01,"Yes, I suspect GOOGL will be going bankrupt by year end ",
11422,2018-10-13,"Hello traders of the r/stocks sub!

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week of October 15th - 19th, 2018.

# **Earnings could be what turns the tide for stocks** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/earnings-could-be-what-turns-the-tide-for-stocks.html)*

* Earnings season gets underway in the week ahead, and that could help calm some of the frayed nerves in the stock market if corporate outlooks remain positive.
* Stocks bounced on Friday, and the S&P 500 landed back on an important technical level, a positive way to start the week ahead.
* Fed speakers and minutes from the Fed's last meeting will be a big focus, after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's hawkish comments suggesting more rate hikes sparked a recent jump in interest rates.

*****
> Stocks fell on Friday after the release of mixed employment data jolted interest rates higher.
*****
> After the wildest market week in months, investors are looking to U.S. corporate earnings season to soothe frayed nerves in the coming week.
*****
> Stocks sold off sharply in the past week, and even with a bounce back on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 4.1 percent. A sudden jump in interest rates and worries about the impact of tariffs and trade disputes on earnings drove stocks lower, with some of the worst losses in growth stocks.
*****
> The S&P ended the week on a high note, up 1.4 percent on Friday but closing at 2,767, one point above its 200-day moving average. The moving average is a momentum measure, and it is widely watched, even beyond stock market chartists.
*****
> ""The S&P 500 closed right on the 200-day. It's just like a magnet. Everyone looks at these levels as super important, and that's where it ended up,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR. ""We enter next week on tenterhooks. There's a whole lot of nervousness. ... Sitting on support, rather than sitting on resistance, is always a better way to enter the earnings season.""
*****
> Companies reporting in the week ahead include Bank of America on Monday; Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Johnson and Johnsonand IBM on Tuesday; Abbott Labs on Wednesday; American Expresson Thursday and Procter and Gamble on Friday.

# Why Bulls Smile After Midterm Elections

> Volatility is heating up in October, with some big drops for stocks late last week. Now let‚Äôs put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn‚Äôt closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row‚Äîone of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.

> ‚ÄúSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,‚Äù said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.

> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**

# So ‚ÄúSell in May‚Äù Didn‚Äôt Work This Year?

> Not so fast. The answer is: We don‚Äôt know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow‚Äôs and S&P‚Äôs Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ‚Äôs Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. 

> The market‚Äôs rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it‚Äôs down 5.0% at yesterday‚Äôs close. 

> The past two days have reminded everyone of October‚Äôs frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October‚Äôs scary record. 

> ‚ÄúThe term ‚ÄúOctoberphobia‚Äù has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don‚Äôt get whipsawed if it happens‚Ä¶. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.‚Äù 

> October isn‚Äôt over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let‚Äôs not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it‚Äôs only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the ‚ÄúSweet Spot‚Äù of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. 

> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ‚Äôs Best 8 Months. 

> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud ‚Äúshould I sell?‚Äù And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.

What are you all watching for this upcoming week? Good trading to everyone in here on this new trading week ahead!

*****

Have a fantastic trading week r/stocks! :)The Stock Market Thread for the trading week beginning October 15th, 2018",
11423,2018-10-13,Wow. Please post these every week! Great info.,
11424,2018-10-13,Hi there new friend :-)  Thanks for all of the info!  ,
11425,2018-10-13,Nice job!,

",
11428,2018-10-14,What a fuckin saint. This is amazing!,
11429,2018-10-14,"So many important earnings this week which will determine whether we rally for the rest of 2018. If they report terribly watch out below.

Netflix- could power up the FANGs up 20% If they recover from the crappy q3 earnings. If they have a good report buy tech, as it typically rallies hard after a good Netflix report. Counter a bad report with DIS calls.

UnitedHeath- if they report a good quarter buy Health ETF. As they dominate those or look out for names like Centene or Athenahealth. Bad report and you should pull out of any Health stocks, sector has overperformed and due for a pullback.

CSX- If they report higher guidance go heavy on KSU or UNP.  If not  puts on XPO, CHRW and the transportation sector as a whole.

BAC- has the largest CALL options volume in the market. Everyone is expecting a good quarter if it fails; oh boy a lot of money will be burned.

Lam Research- Semiconductor is glued to LAM bad report will easily rip 5-10% off all semi etfs which are all underperforming.",

11452,2018-10-16,"From The Bloomberg Close:


""The reasons for Friday's rally were as varied as for the rout. Trade data from China eased growth concerns. There were signs trade tensions might ease, between next month's meeting with the U.S., and the Treasury's finding that China isn't manipulating the yuan. And relief on bank earnings mollified those worried about corporate profits.""

I am considering a few very beaten down names for earnings plays and perhaps a QQQ long position for earnings week but likely small plays - definitely worried that guidance will be lowered by tariffs for some companies. Think the market needs trade tensions to ease to head back to highs, but earnings these next two weeks could give us some direction.

11545,2018-08-14,"The top three in this category are Netflix, hulu, and amazon. 

Disney is acquiring Fox.

Hulu currently uses a 30/30/30/10 media split of their streaming service listed below:

- 30% Disney
- 30% Fox
- 30% Universal
- 10% Warner 

Disney is supposedly talking about taking their content to their own streaming service. This would take away 60% of the HULU's content (30%DIS / 30%FOX)

Hulu filed a loss of several billion this year, and lost $920mil last year after receiving a Billion in investments from parents.

I have a theory that Disney, if they launch that streaming service (or announce it), will bump HULU out of the top 3. 

Can I get some opinions here? I always though of Disney as a cute stock to buy somebody, but with all the moves they plan to make and are currently making, I might really dive into this one. 

I have yet to review technical analysis on all of these stocks.Top dogs control 70% of the market. (Hulu, NTFLX, AMZN, DIS)",
11546,2018-08-14,"Read Disney's conference call response about streaming services. 

They will own 60% of Hulu. They're not going to do try to wreck Hulu.

From the conference call:

""Regarding Netflix and our strategy regarding the apps, first of all, because we will be launching the Disney app into the market probably in about, well, a year, sometime the end of calendar 2019, we're going to walk before we run as it relates to volume of content because it takes time to build the kind of content library that ultimately we intend to build.

That said, because the Disney app will feature Pixar, Marvel, Disney, ultimately National Geographic will be a contributor, Lucasfilm, Star Wars, we feel that it does not have to have anything close to the volume of what Netflix has because of the value of the brands and the specific value of the programs that will be included on it. And the price, by the way, will also reflect a lower volume of product as will, by the way, the cost of producing and owning all that content.

Obviously, after the deal closes for 21st Century Fox, we'll own 60% of Hulu. So that will fit in very significantly to our app strategy. And then I talked about in my earlier comments and we've spoken a fair amount about this in the past, we have the ESPN app.

As we look at all three, it is our feeling ‚Äì and as we look at the environment today, I guess one thing you could even point to would be the great growth in the new digital OTT offerings where you're looking at essentially fewer channels, slightly less choice for less cost. We don't really want to go to market with an aggregation play that replicates the multi-channel environment that exists today because we feel consumers are more interested in essentially making decisions on their own in terms of what kind of packages that they want.

So rather than one, let's call it, gigantic aggregated play, we're going to bring to the market what we've already brought to market, sports play. I'll call it Disney Play, which is more family-oriented. And then, of course, there's Hulu. And they will basically be designed to attract different tastes and different segment or audience demographics.

If a consumer wants all three, ultimately, we see an opportunity to package them from a pricing perspective. But it could be that a consumer just wants sports or just wants family or just wants the Hulu offering, and we want to be able to offer that kind of flexibility to consumers because that's how we feel the consumer behavior, what consumer behavior demands in today's environment.""",

* When viewing what the company could be worth from future revenues, and considering the profit margin growth rate, the company is significantly overvalued.Netflix: lets talk about that. Will netflix reach 400? And how do people even determine that a company is overvalued?",
11642,2018-11-29,"So conflicted on Netflix.

I think Netflix is trading more on potential vs. the actual financials. Actually it MUST be. I've seen so many people saying that the PE and high debt make this a ticking time bomb, and they may be right. But, when you look at the company you see: 

* A company approaching 150mln paying subs....globally. What other company can boast this? Even disney with their newly acquired goodies can't come close. 
* User growth has continued to be very healthy. Yes the US has slowed, but globally Netflix continues to grow very rapidly. There are more people outside the USA , than are in the USA
* With their constantly increasing sub base, they seem to have decent pricing power. People may complain about $1 or $2 price increases, but the reality is, even at $15 per month, Netflix for most is a tremendous value. 
* Then we get to their land grab in india. As of right now they're trailing a distant 3rd place (or maybe it was 4th), but this market is still in it's infancy and the potential is huge. 
* They also SEEM to be making investments in things that will extend past just Netflix specials and exclusive content. 
   * Their investment in Millarworld and hire(s) this year in merchandising expertise suggest to me that they have aspirations to rival Marvel & DC in content & merchandising 
   * Their partnership with Microsoft for interactive Minecraft and other interactive stories hints at possible gaming aspirations

Then we get to the technology aspect. 

They have half a decade or more of a head start on the competition when it comes to content recommendation, content delivery, content presentation and more. I think people often look past this when they think of Netflix. They don't take into account the amount of money Netflix has been focused on spending on their content delivery, recommendation engine, UI for the plethora of hardware & software platforms their app is on (they're even integrated into hardware remotes for cable boxes, television sets, and more!). 

&#x200B;

And, when I look at the competition, let's look at 

&#x200B;

HBO. 

With Game of Thrones ending soon, Westworld and others lagging behind in terms of hype and excitement, HBO WILL have to pull many more rabbits out of their hats in order to justify long term, high value subscriptions. I just don't see HBO being very sticky when their content library while they have some tremendous hits, isn't (I guess in my opinion) that strong outside of GOT and a handful of others. 

&#x200B;

Apple. 

From all accounts, Apple will be spending a small fraction of Netflix's budget on content. They also will undoubtedly be making their platform exclusive to Apple devices. A huge market no doubt, but will still limit them. Add to this that to date, their content attempts have been utter trash. They've invested in some astounding talent now, so the jury is still out on what they'll deliver in the future. Apple is still working to catch up to Spotify, and from all accounts, Apple's service is almost on par with Spotify's in terms of what they offer a subscriber but 3 years in they are STILL trying to catch up with Spotify. Is it realistic to think that they'll be able to catch up to or replace Netflix in anything less than 5 years?  I see any service apple has as a nice value add for people who are in the iOS ecosystem, but not as a substitute for Netflix. 

&#x200B;

Amazon

Amazon has been around, and has had success, but they're focus hasn't seemed to be on streaming video. This shows in all aspects of their service.

&#x200B;

Disney

The monster with the biggest franchises, the bottomless well of AAA content, and properties which span every genre. There's no doubt in my mind that had Disney invested in streaming video at the same time when Netflix was starting, Netflix would be a pebble to Disney's mountain. However, the horse has left the stable and Disney will have to develop and invest in everything that Netflix has been focused on for the last 5 to 10 years. if anything, I think people will have disney's service(s) in addition to Netflix. Add to this, that Netflix already has a huge global footprint in streaming, while I believe Disney will be focusing on the USA to begin with. Yes, Disney ""has"" hulu, but, Hulu has been around for years, and we see their success vs. NEtflix. Turning that ship around will not be a quick or easy process. 

&#x200B;

All the above doesn't even take into account the possibility (or better yet, pipe dream) of Netflix entering the China market. Currently they provide content to IQIYI, but, should that market ever truly open up, through their already established partnership with IQIYI, presents another tremendous opportunity for them

&#x200B;

All that said  they continue to burn money on content, and have yet to justify their VERY lofty PE. Given that the market seems to be looking at companies with questionable financials a little more carefully, I do wonder if most of the reward has not already been reaped from Netflix over the last 5 years, vs. the next 5

11644,2018-11-30,"To answer your 2nd question as to how you can tell if an asset is over/undervalued:

1.) If the asset your valuing is a stock, then you need to compare the market price to a fundamental valuation. There are two ways to do this: a Dividend Discount model, or a Discounted Cash Flow model. Both will derive roughly what the book value per share of that stock is. Keep in mind all you're looking is what the company is worth based on historicals, not future earnings. There will almost always be a variance, and that variance is how the market feels about that specific company. This is why valuing a stock based on fundamentals can be very subjective.

2.) If you want to know if an option is over/under valued, you'll need to run a Black-Scholes-Merton model, or a Binomial Lattice model. Both of these take into account things like underlying asset's price, Beta, implied volatility, etc. This tends to be a little more straight forward than valuing a stock since the input factors are known and publicly available (i.e. Beta, IV, Strike price will not vary from analyst to analyst). If the results of your model comes out to be less than the market, you can assume the option is undervalued (for a call) and visa versa.",

Apple is still trying to establish its own version of a streaming service. They are currently failing though because their products are cost prohibitive.

Disney will be taking away all of its content and will be starting its own streaming line.

Then we get to the tech behind their content delivery. Part of the reason it seem so 'worthless' to you, may be that its not obvious what the tech is. I've used Netflix all around the world, on various connection speeds on various devices, and it's always a pleasant experience with no or minima buffering. That takes millions or billions of investment. 

As for Amazon. Amazon DID survive both the dot come bubble burst AND the 'great recession'. But you are right, the level of competition Amazon faced in it's early days may not be the same level of competition Netflix is going to face in 2020 and onwards.

11736,2018-08-02,Just bout my first stock of Netflix at 344 today! Just bought my first stock!,
11737,2018-08-02,Yeah man! Buy high sell low!,
11738,2018-08-02,[removed],
11739,2018-08-02,Great! When are you planning on selling it?,
11740,2018-08-03,"Just don‚Äôt get confused between investing and day trading. Investing in a stock requires research, due diligence and time, time of which is the most important. Do not get caught up in the swings every day, it‚Äôll stress you out and you‚Äôll make positions or sell based off emotions and that could be costly. A good place to start would be established stocks with growth and potential. I‚Äôd recommend AAPL and MSFT for starters, but you should probably wait till there‚Äôs a nice dip. Last advice, and most important, do not invest more than you‚Äôre willing to lose. Best of luck!",
11741,2018-08-02,Good for you man. I also just bought my first stock a month or so ago. It‚Äôs a great feeling but keep up on your research. It helps a lot.,

11759,2018-08-03,"Congrats! Don‚Äôt sweat the naysayers on here.

When you‚Äôre happy with your initial investment and in a position financially to start growing and diversifying, I‚Äôd suggest doing research on companies that‚Äôs been around for some time that pays out some sort of dividends. 

Some people take a more aggressive approach to the market. (I.e chase trendy stocks or try to get ahead of a fad stock. High risk, high reward.) there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. Some take a more conservative approach. Find what you like and try to do it well. 

Good luck on your investment(s)",

11890,2018-08-17,"So, I understand that around this time, subscriber growth numbers were released, that did not impress.  However, the stock dropped $50 in a single 5 minute window.  Is this indicative of a massive selloff by a few large shareholders?  There was no indication in the previous candles, and it was such a steep drop.   


[https://imgur.com/maV4hCk](https://imgur.com/maV4hCk) What Happened to NFLX July 17 at 13:30?",
11891,2018-08-17,"Subscriber growth lagged. Disney confirmed its intention to not renew Netflix contracts in lieu of their own streaming platform. Netflix financials show that they overbudget for their proprietary content, and they will continue on this trend. 

Because NFLX is losing 3rd party content every month, and the Netflix originals they are replacing it with have not shown to be cost - effective. Netflix is putting out 10-20 new titles every quarter, and very few of them are real money makers. People sub for OITNB or Stranger Things. But for every one of those, they're putting out 5 flops.

This is also the same time that FB gave its guidance about lower returns into 2019, so tech in general was unstable at the time.",
11892,2018-08-18,Thanks for the insight. Hearing they also recently started throwing out ads for their own content makes me nervous. I bought in at $97 a share - only 3 shares though . Debating on selling...,
11893,2018-08-19,"It dropped $50 after hours on July 16th after their earnings call, not on July 17th at 13:30",
11894,2018-08-18,"I' m down 5k right now with Netflix, What do you think? Should i pull out or wait for it to go back up in price, Subscriber growth surely will be better in the winter. During the summer months people are out doing things and going on vacation and not watching tv as much. What do you guys think?",
11895,2018-08-17,"Thanks, that is actaully pretty insightful. Makes sense why this was probably dropped from a lot of portfolios. 

I was considering picking it up at 315 today, but I am not sure if it is a good short term investment. ",
11896,2018-08-18,"IMO, as much as I hate ads personally, it isn't enough for people to leave the platform.  Especially if it allows them to keep their current price longer.  To u/Barry_Allen_ s point, it is about them keeping content that is interesting.

My fear, as a consumer, is that we are taking the outdated TV model and moving it online.  With each company having their own streaming service, then forcing ads on us.  It is exactly why we moved to Netflix in the first place.  ...sigh.

But as far as investing, I am gonna hold off for the next few months and watch it.  Sticking with AMD, AMC, MU, etc.If you only have 3 shares I would hold for a little longer.  It might recover a bit.",
11897,2018-08-18,I think it will recover. I‚Äôm expecting it to drop another 20-30 and then I‚Äôm all in. ,
11898,2018-10-12,"What do you guys think? Is Netflix in for a further fall? They have been steadily growing for the past 6 months. Only a month ago they were over $400 a share. Now, they have been steadily dropping over the past two weeks.

Earnings will be announced on the 16 and analysts have mixed feelings. Some say buy and others are saying sell.
Netflix Doomed??? Down $50/Share...",
11899,2018-10-12,Only on here can you find someone who describes a stock that‚Äôs up 65%+ year to date as doomed in the title.,
11900,2018-10-12,"Ignoring the stock prices, just answer me this. Where will Netflix's future growth come from? New users? Increasing prices? Acquisitions? It's not clear to me where they go from here.",
11901,2018-10-12,"I never liked this stock...simply not a sustainable business model when content is what you need and your future competitors have better content...Disney, AT&T and Comcast own most of the great content out there and they will get their services going over next 2 years.

Upside is Netflix had a long headstart with client base, data and algorithm.",
11902,2018-10-14,"From what I've read, they're doing well with their expansion into foreign markets which should push them along for a while longer. I could also see them finding more revenue if they tighten up their policies regarding account sharing. Everyone I know is passing their account around to friends like the village whore.  

This big push towards creating - and owning - their own content is key for them, and I think they've shown that they have the ability to pull big name talent from Hollywood. They just need to make sure it doesn't suck. Some of what I've seen is pretty bad.

Also seems like a big part of their recent drop had to do with an overzealous pre-earnings push that couldn't break through a technical resistance. That reversal just added momentum to the panic that we saw market wide last week. Netflix debt is locked in for the next couple years, and last earnings was a near miss in part due to miscalculating their own estimates, so so long as they post decent numbers, I think they'll bounce back big.",
11903,2018-10-12,"YTD has been great. 5-year has been amazing. 
However, what's to come?",
11904,2018-10-12,"LOL. 

But what is their stock average? If they didn't get that 65% gain this year, then they are feeling the loss. ",
11905,2018-10-12,"I understand his/her concern though. Many people have canceled Netflix subscriptions after years of usage. I myself have as well. A lot of us have found better options, as Netlfix axed alot of great shows over the past couple of years.

Im guessing that Netlfix will fail to innovate and pull in as many new users as they had estimated.

By doomed, I assume OP is taking about long term investment. In which case, I'd say I don't think Netlfix is a set in stone type of investment. It could definitely fall out of popularity if they don't innovate. Their service alone has declined IMO. ",
11906,2018-10-12,"The concern that I've had for a while now in regards to Netflix is the enormous spending on content, but - how does that ever change? I just seem them having to be continually running on the hamster wheel of spending a fortune year in/year out on programming.

There's syndication, merchandising, sports, perhaps some other innovation (gaming), but none of those things are a guaranteed success (and there's a fair amount of content on Netflix that doesn't exactly lend itself to merchandise.)

So congrats to Netflix shareholders, but it's just something that I was never sold on looking much longer term. Roku being the O/S for 25% of smart TVs being sold today, that has a little more appeal from the standpoint of being essentially the ""app store""/gateway for that TV and they continue to do a very good job building up the advertising platform.",
11907,2018-10-12,Ip? Back catalog? Royalties?,
11908,2018-10-12,"Interactive Movies or TV Shows / Game streaming (no more console or PC) / Sports and so on...

Im on the fence",
11909,2018-10-12,"It is troublesome. Many other companies are on the rise and doing what they do. Disney is set to pull all of their content from every online streaming platform and they will roll out with their own platform. That will mean a huge hit for other online streaming companies. 

Netflix will have to grow by producing more of its own shows and movies.",
11910,2018-10-12,"Yes, they were ahead of the curve. Now people are trying to do what they do and do it better. Could be trouble in a year or two.",

11914,2018-10-12,Netflix is about to feel some burn from Disney when their streaming starts. ,
11915,2018-10-12,They‚Äôre going to have to get new comers/smaller names in the film industry so they don‚Äôt have to pay huge salaries. Also maybe release in episodes not all at one time. ,
11916,2018-10-15,the only hope for netflix is if they cut their spending to 1/4th and keep the same amount of subscribers. Don't know if people will still stay if the content creation goes down.,
11917,2018-10-12,"How are Hey going to monetize that beyond what they‚Äôre doing? IP and Catalog are already monetized and Netflix is in the business of horsing content, not licensing it out. So no royalties. They have a single revenue source - subscriber payments. They‚Äôre experimenting with Merchandise but that‚Äôs not going to go anywhere. ",
11918,2018-10-12,Still in a bubble. 150 PE ratio? Give me a break. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd even be comfortable at half of that. ,

#**DISCUSS!**

What is on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Friday, September 28th, 2018! :)**(9/28) - Friday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News",
11930,2018-09-28,"Final trading day of September and Q3 today. Hope everyone had a pretty good trading month and quarter.

What were some of your best winners for the month and quarter?",
11931,2018-09-28,Pytg just went up 40% for me in 1 day,
11932,2018-09-28,Definitely ACBFF for me.,
11933,2018-08-07,"Looking forward to post-bell Wednesday earnings!

Some predictions:

1) DIS beats earnings forecast, price rises 3%. Going off strong Avengers / Black Panther sales, PLUS the big FOX buy, PLUS the fact that it will seem like a breakout signal for those looking for a signal to buy--a self-fulfilling prophecy. Nobody wants to miss getting on board Netflix 2.

2) NFLX goes UP 1%, AMZN up 0.5%. The standard belief is that if Disney/Hulu succeeds in any way, it signals a Netflix failure, or at least forecasts Netflix ceding a large chunk of the market. In reality, I think long-term investors & hedge fund managers see the global streaming entertainment market for what it is: a growing industry with plenty of room for competition & huge growth opportunity in emerging markets.

What's your predictions?

EDIT: Got it right in the wrong direction. DIE DISNEY DIE DIE!!!DISNEY EARNINGS",
11934,2018-08-07,DIS has the heavy deadweight of ESPN+ earnings. There are rumors it has been coming around so this could be big if they have made it profitable. ,
11935,2018-08-07,The run up today on such high volume tells me the big institutional investors think the report will be good. I had a position but increased it today.,
11936,2018-08-07,F,
11937,2018-08-07,">PLUS the big FOX buy

The Fox merger in the first few quarters will only decrease earnings (EDIT: I mean eps) if anything.

",
11938,2018-08-07,Drops 3% and gains it all back and then some in less than an hour!,
11939,2018-08-07,"Fingers crossed. 

Q3 period is April, May, June so most of Black Panther sales were already reported in Q2. But  Infinity War and Incredibles 2 will probably pick up the slack from lackluster Solo and Ant Man 2 sales. ",
11940,2018-08-07,"There‚Äôs a floor for espn somewhere, and I believe it will be found sooner rather than later, and likely will transition into a streaming/a-la-carte service as more people abandon traditional cable subscriptions. Sports will always have a major draw, and espn is the undisputed king of sports. ",
11941,2018-08-07,F,
11942,2018-08-07,Do you think this has been factored into the current price?,
11943,2018-08-07,This statment is so wrong it‚Äôs sad.,
11944,2018-08-07,"It's sad you don't tell why.

M&A is a costly business in the first quarters: fees for the firm that completes the M&A, lay-offs happening, synergy issues, ...",
11945,2018-08-07,"Beause, it shows people here have no idea what goes into top line eps. ",
11946,2018-08-07,Did you just say top line eps? lol,
11947,2018-11-25,"During a bear market, tech and other growth companies are generally the ones that experience the biggest corrections in share prices due to poor fundamentals and high P/E ratios. However, it doesn't change the fact that investing in general is always about future value. Obviously 'future' is subjective and will vary from person to person, as some people are looking to invest for 5 years while others are looking to set-and-forget for 20+ years, but the point is - people are essentially making a long-term bet that the company will evolve into a stronger leader in its respective industry.

FANG (Facebook ($FB), Amazon ($AMZN), Netflix ($NFLX), and Alphabet ($GOOG)) have been the 4 powerhouse tech stocks that consistently beat the market. As of August 10, 2017 ‚Äî while the NASDAQ 100 was up 19 percent and the S&P 500 was up 8.9 percent year-to-date (YTD) ‚Äî FANGs were up more than 2x that of the latter. Year-to-date, Facebook (FB) was up 45 percent, Amazon (AMZN) 27 percent, Netflix (NFLX) 36 percent and Alphabet‚Äôs Google (GOOG) 16 percent, beating the returns of both indices. (Source: Yahoo Finance)

As we reach the peak of the 'tech bubble', people have questioned whether the year-over-year growth for FANG is sustainable, while others added to their bullish sentiment with the inclusion of other industry leaders -- In Sept. 2018, CNBC published an article that said that Square ($SQ) should be part of the FANG group based on the hyper-bullish sentiment of a Nomura Instinet analyst, who also set a massive price target of $125 per share.

October 2018 - The Motley Fool came out with an article ([https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/10/09/forget-fang-stocks-meet-mana.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/10/09/forget-fang-stocks-meet-mana.aspx)) titled \*Forget FANG Stocks: Meet MANA\* (Microsoft ($MSFT), Apple ($AAPL), Netflix ($NFLX), Amazon ($AMZN))

Q3 ERs for most tech companies were disasters - most beat Q2 expectations, but they slipped on the Q4 guidance. Whether you believe that they are sandbagging is up to you, but people hoped that strong ER and Q4 guidance from FANG/FANGS/FAANG/MANA was going to prop up the market from further slide -- they didn't. If I recall correctly, Netflix was the one that had the strongest ER and jumped nearly 13% in the after hours. Apple bombed on their iPhone sales and announced that going forward, they would no longer be reporting iPhone sales unit numbers. People started to question whether FANG had enough innovation left in their tanks to continue to grow and drive expansion.

\*\*So what's next?\*\* There are a number of advancements that are on the verge of a major breakthrough and adoption:

\* Robotics/AI

\* 5G

\* Quantum computing

\* Internet of Things (IoT)

\* Blockchain (this does not necessarily mean cryptocurrencies)

\* Gene editing/modification

\* Healthcare/Biotech/Pharmaceuticals

What technologies are you bullish on for the future? Which companies are you investing for said tech?

EDIT 1: totally forgot about VR/ARIs FANG maxed out? The most promising technologies of the next decade (2020 and beyond) and which companies to invest in?",
11948,2018-11-25,"Most of those technologies you mention are spearheaded by the FAANG though.

Ie Goog, Amzn and Fb lead the AI and Deep Learning space.

Goog invested heavily in robotics until recently.

Goog already has the highest bit Quantum computer prototypes available today. They have plans to open its APIs to GCloud customers in a few years.

Amzn Aapl and Google are leading parts of IoT and definitely are core parts of integration protocols.

Blockchain is an interesting technology but not one that cannot be replicated (as we can see again and again with the recent protocols). It is a glorified linkedlist at the end of the day, and can be produced in house by FAANG.

Don‚Äôt know much about 5G maybe someone else can clarify on that.

VR is lead by FB owned Oculus and Steam powered Vive.

TLDR; Most of *tomorrows‚Äô technologies* are already under FAANG umbrella.",
11949,2018-11-25,"I thought it's now FAGMAN. Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Netflix.",
11950,2018-11-25,"Don't forget other big things like

* Self-driving car - GOOGL
* Robotic Surgery - ISRG",
11951,2018-11-25,"1. I don't think this is a technology bubble, FB for example is trading at 17x forward earnings
2. I still think the social media space isn't done innovating, things like social shopping, PPV live events, social ""media consumption"", are still area of tremendous potential growth
3. I'm invested in FB partly because I believe they will be the major player in VR, and a major player in AR. I believe those two technologies will experience a lot of growth over the next decade.",
11952,2018-11-25,"There are certainly instances of big companies like those in FAANG failing, maxing out, or stalling out but I don't think that's what we're seeing with FAANG. Usually that can happen when competition is strong or a company fails to stay relevant / pivot with their industry.

Let's talk about the moat for a moment. Warren Buffett is a notorious value investor. He essentially tries to find value mismatches where he sees a company as undervalued comparative to the rest of the investment community. With that said, another important component to Buffett's investment style is to find companies with a strong moat. That is, to find companies that have strong defenses against other companies in their industry group or sector. These moats allow some companies to remain the dominant company in their industry regardless of the economy or the overall state of the market.

With that said, my company is currently partnered with Google, and that's about as far as I'm willing to go into detail on that. But what I can say is that Google has a very strong moat. It's absolutely insane what Google is working on in their development teams and companies. I don't think Google thinks about how much money they can make tomorrow. I think Google thinks about how they can make money for eternity, and if that means losing money tomorrow so be it. Google is positioned very strongly and I don't think they're going anywhere anytime soon. If they can continue to innovative they will be unstoppable, even if they stall out for a few years.

My point here is that, no, I don't think some of those companies are maxed out. I think you might be onto something with the idea that a correction or bear market might be coming and tech might take a big hit. As some people have mentioned, many technologies that you posted about are already being worked on by members of FAANG. I know companies like Amazon and Google are working very hard to stay, not only relevant, but to BE the future. Quantum computing, advanced cloud technology, AI technology and application, advanced robotics, and VR are just a few things that companies under FAANG are working on. As you mentioned, though, too, timeframe is an important consideration. If you're wondering if tech is going to explode right now, in the next couple months, probably not. I haven't taken my eye off of FAANG, though. Especially Google. I'm waiting on the sidelines at the moment to watch their development and the development of the US market.

This doesn't mean that FAANG can't fail. A strong moat can only protect but it cannot project. Companies in FAANG will have to continue to work at being the best at coming out with new content or some other company will do it and that presents an opportunity for failure. I still think of much of FAANG as leaders, though. Only time will tell.

Example using external source information:

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/051316/buffetts-moat-how-sustainable-googles-competitive-advantage-googl.asp

I focus on Google as my main example because I generally understand their business the best within the FAANG umbrella.

TLDR - FAANG maxed out, no, I don't think so. Good time to buy into FAANG, eh, probably not.",
11953,2018-11-25,"I'm long on $FB and $GOOG. Also on $MSFT simply due to their cloud computing and the IoT's need to store data. Those three together cover all the bases I'm confident on. 

I've had Netflix in my portfolio but slowly going to start taking profits I feel. ",
11954,2018-11-25,"I know China isn‚Äôt the most popular right now, but their markets are beaten to fuck and they are the fastest growing market in both GDP and internet space. They have the highest users on the internet (over 700 million people) and only about 50 percent saturated.

11960,2018-11-25,"It‚Äôs so unlikely to me that tech won‚Äôt continue to outperform over the next 5, 10, 20 years... what argument is there to be made that they won‚Äôt?",
11961,2018-11-25,"Motley Fool changes FANG and doesn't include Google?

Is there anyone who thinks that Google isn't a good long term investment?",
11962,2018-11-26,"There is genuine strength and weakness in FANG. Here is my take. 

Facebook is week for a couple reasons but strong for one big one. It's week because it IS so powerful and widely used and therefor influential. Congress wants to regulate it. It's CEO is under intense scrutiny. But then it's users, DON'T REALLY CARE about any of that and will continue to use it because there is no other alternative! It will continue to rake in advertising dollars because its' algorithms provide superior access to the people that advertisers want to reach. It makes money. Don't confuse that with the stock price. 

Alphabet. Are you joking? It's a money tree. It controls 90% of search. There are alternatives that nobody uses(Bing). It's algorithms are superior. Advertisers love it, but also are beholden to it's dominance. Because of this, again, it's under scrutiny by regulators. That's just search. What about Android mobile? Largest mobile platform in the WORLD. It dominates mobile. Don't forget it owns YouTube which has a superior (Imo) business model to content than Netflix. It has more users than facebook, and people spend more time on YouTube than Facebook. Advertisers mostly love it, but they'll go wherever the eyeballs are.  Now, the headlines that Google gets are usually over Self Driving cars and their moonshot ideas. But don't forget, years ago, everyone said they were insane for trying to map the world and take a photo of every street on the planet. And now, Google Maps is $4 billion a year in revenue. Don't bet against Google's ""other bets"". Also, their smartphone is superior to other phones, it's just not cool enough yet, but gaining traction, even if it's very small. Google may be maturing, but it's a long term hold if you think the internet will exist in 20 years. 

Apple: They haven't blown our minds in a long time with a new product. But they have a giant installed user based just like Microsoft did 20 years ago. I think they are a mature company with less rocket like growth ahead of them, but the stock is pretty cheap on a relative basis. If they can grow in other areas such as content and services they will be around. Right now it does seem that Cook is content with incremental growth instead of new products. 

Netflix is stupid. This is my least favorite of the FANGS. I've been wrong on their stock price for years. But I'm not wrong on their business model. Which HAS to change. Here is why. They finance their expensive content creation with debt. They spend more on content than HBO and Disney. And they have to borrow money in junk bonds to do so. Their cashflow is negative to zero! They don't really have any profits. Their competition is growing every day. Amazon Prime, YouTube, AppleTV, Disney all have or will have streaming services. Content is expensive and they have only ONE way to pay for it, debt. Whereas Amazon has prime memberships and a retail to subsidize. Disney has theater ticket sales, and YouTube has FREE content! Think about it, Netflix has 1 of 2 choices. Either they start placing ads in their stream, or they raise their monthly fees. They can't keep borrowing forever. With rates rising is that good for their debt? nope. Their last earnings report was not great, but they added subs, which is all they anyone seems to look at. But they are nothing but another channel. 

Amazon is the most powerful in my opinion. It's the one to own now. Not only does it control 50% of internet retail, it has other bets in other industries that it can disrupt easily if it chooses to. It could disrupt UPS and FedX simply buy doing all their own shipping in house. They own a fleet of Boeing jets.  It has Prime, which is like a Costco membership, a Spotify membership and a Netflix account for one price.  Amazon music is better than Spotify (just not as popular), Prime is about as good as Netflix and same day delivery and 2 day delivery is killing brick and mortar this holiday season.  Whole Foods is soon going to have Pharmacy options that will disrupt WalGreens and CVS. Which is BILLIONS . Oops I forget to mention AWS. Which is the number 1 cloud business by a LONG SHOT. With huge margins and BILLIONS AND BILLIONS in revenue. And they are soon to get the Pentagon contract as well. This company can do almost anything. I say almost because it has had hardware product failures. But Alexa is a massive win along with FireTV but its' phone was not.

That being said let‚Äôs go back to your pint since I like this discussion. You are right that adoption of developers are important, but only because it is a proxy measure of adoption from the common folk (also known as b2c model). Take MacOS for instance. It has been a clear loser in terms of developer adoption compared to Windows. Would you call Mac laptops failures? If you spin off Macbook and MacOS section of Apple
as a new company, it would still be worth higher than the %60 of ‚Äòtop‚Äô companies people invest in.

Another point is that Oculus is not like sth where other platform software won‚Äôt work on them. You can use your Oculus to play SteamVR games for instance.

Finally we are wrapping our minds around gaming or university grants in general, but to be honest we do not know yet where the Vr adoption will happen. It can be a new type of SecondLife like simulation, it can be Virtual Travel, it can be guided surgeries ... who can tell Oculus is losing the adoption game when its parent company has access to the biggest network of people in the whole wide world?

12072,2018-09-13,"Brief background: I use Robinhood. Any money I have in it is purely from free stocks received from referred friends. I got lucky and sold everything to buy a single share of CGC a day or two before STZ dumped a ton of money into them, got pretty great returns.

So, since I'm using literally free money, I'm LETTIN IT RIDE. I've dumped my single share of CGC stock and I'm looking to try and replicate my ""success"". Any suggestions? I've got about $50 to play with here.

I tried asking /r/wallstreetbets but they don't take kindly to hobos like me, apparently. Their words, not mine.",

So far, $MRK has been nothing but kind for my portfolio. It just crossed what I believe to have been the resistance line of 70, now knocking on 71 in AH. If it stays above 70 tomorrow, I might go ahead and add another share or two.",

admittedly, these threads can be quite tedious to put together...i've been pretty inconsistent putting these out every morning, but i try to get one up if i have time in the mornings. i think i was able to get 3 up this week which for me is kind of impressive given that most times i'm lucky to even get 1 up for the week. :P

i'll try to improve on this as we head into the fall though.

FOR TRADING August 17th
 
Retail Revival with WalMart
 
 
The market started on the upside and never looked back.  The aforementioned WMT was clearly the star of the day opening at $100 +9.88 (10.8%).  Along with the new ‚Äútrade talks‚Äù the market went unencumbered to finish +396.32 (1.58%), NASDAQ +32.40 (.42%), S&P 500 +22.32 (.79%), The Russell +15.09 (.90%), and the DJ Transports +75.41 (.68%).  Market internals were stilted in the direction of the DJIA with the top 6 gainers were BA +96, WMT +57, CAT +29, GS +25, AAPL +21 and UNH +17 for a 6 stock total of 245 Dow points.  The index‚Äôs internals were 9:1 up with only 3 losers.  So, the NYSE outperformed NASDAQ with volume of 2.5:1 and A/D 3:1 vs. 5:4 and 2.6:1 respectively.  
 
SECTORS:
 
Other names in the news, yesterday‚Äôs ugliness was lain at the feet of M, and today‚Äôs monster rally was based on Retail.  WMT beat and as mentioned above spent the day hovering around $100 closing the day $98.64 +8.42 (9.33%).  It bears mentioning here that a company with a $300Billion market cap is not easily moved by 9% in either direction.  Volume today was 43MM.  Other retail names reporting today were JCP with a widening loss and several downgrades finished $1.76-.65 (27%), JWN with a beat and after trading $60 +8 is now 57.61 +5.31 (10.15%), DDS beat expectations but was still a loss and traded 69.88 at the low, down from 94 3 days ago but the last is 76.20 -7.18 (8,65%).  Away from retail, tech stocks were also soft with NVDA beating top and bottom lines but gave poor guidance and is trading $244.50 -12.94 (5.4%), AMAT also beat but gave poor guidance and is trading $45.40 -2.03 (4.3%).
 
BIO/PHARMA, today they were HIGHER with CELG +.95, BIIB +2.21, REGN +10.65 (2.94%), ISRG +1.13, ABBV +1.30, MYL +.08, TEVA +1.77 (its generic Epipen coming to market and approved by the FDA today), PRGO +.96, GILD +.81, VRTX +1.96, BHC +.81, INCY +.98, ICPT +1.01, INNT +.32 (6.35%) and IBB +.89 (.77%).
 
RETAIL was MOSTLY HIGHER as mentioned above with M +.71, JWN +4.89, KSS +1.81, DDS -6.98 (8.4%), SHLD (clearly terminal) -.35 (8.5%), JCP -.62 (26%), WMT +8.35, HD +1.02, TJX +1.01, TGT +1.41, DKS +.20 and the brands, RL +.69, UAA +.33, LULU +3.02 (2.4%), NKE +.25, KORS +.18, and XRT +.17(.34%).
 
FAANG, surprisingly the group was MIXED today with the exception of AAPL +2.76 (to another new high +1.31%) GOOGL -9.22, AMZN +4.38 but almost $20 off its high, FB -4.93, NVDA -13.76 (5.4%), TSLA -3.31, NFLX -4.77, IBM +1.11, BOX +.35 (we bought the 9/27 calls @ $1.15 today and they closed $1.05) and XLK +.32 (.44%).
 
FINANCIALS, were HIGHER with GS +3.75, JPM +.97, BAC +.36, AIG +.36, C +.95, PNC +2.45, WFC +.47, and XLF +.37 (1.33%).
 
OIL, $65.46 +.45 Oil was rocked by supply and drawdown numbers yesterday but after hitting a slight new low but closed near the high of the day. Clearly, this makes me wrong about not closing under $66.  The next area of support comes in between $63-64, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a rally on the slightest geopolitical tension.  The stocks were MIXED to HIGHER with XLE +.58 (.81%).
 
 
METALS, $1,184 ‚Äì 1.00 the gold failed to hold the round number of $1,200.  This was partially due to the technical but also the fact that like Oil, it is an international commodity priced in the rising US$.  Last night the pajama traders took it as low as $1,167 -18 before it came back early this morning.  Copper collapsed yesterday closing $2.56 -.1220, but bounced back to close $2.6165 + .0565.  It has broken all support going back to May 2017 at $2.50 to about $2.30. We‚Äôll need better economic numbers to get it started back to the upside.
 
BITCOIN closed $6,405 +30. After trading down to below test support at 6,800 we collapsed again hitting $6,110 before a minor rally to trade 6,615.  Tuesday‚Äôs low of $5855 is just $100 above contract lows of $5,755 could easily be breached and the overhead supply is still from 6,900 to 7,300.  Today was an ‚Äúinside day‚Äù.  According to the CNBC talking head who is the Bitcoin ‚Äúexpert,‚Äù today‚Äôs action is contract expiration related and there should be a rally for the next days.
 
Tomorrow is another day.

Today‚Äôs Market Update",
12088,2018-10-28,"With many A-list companies reporting earnings or already reported, it's normal to see market moves.  However, after several power hitters like Google and Amazon and Netflix all report good/great earnings and the market continues to go down/prices disheartening lows.   I mean in the case of GOOG/AMZN, there was literally NOTHING bad about their report, yet both fell still further.  With AAPL and FB coming up, I'm really wondering what will happen there.  Sparked a question in my investment circle that maybe powerful CEOs/heavy hitters are deliberately reporting weak outlooks to keep the prices falling, while they all accumulate millions of shares and profit when they report ridiculous earnings in the upcoming months to profit big time.  Is this a feasible plan for those kinds of people? 

  
That all said, I'm taking nasty hits on GOOGL, AMZN, NFLX, and FB right now.  AAPL is still up big time for me.  If FB and AAPL both report good earnings (Which means the stocks will tumble because #reasons) I'm going to be up tree.  What does it take to make the market happy about FAANG again? Powerful people creating artificial lows for profits later?",
12089,2018-10-28,"If you can't handle the volatility then don't buy tech stocks.

You're not confident enough to hold them if every time they drop 15% you start calling it market manipulation.",
12090,2018-10-28,"This is why you don't trade or hold through ER. The volatility is too high and even with favorable reports on earnings, guidance, etc...the stock can plummet. The opposite is also true that horrible reports and a stock can jump. The factors that move a stock around earnings are just too unpredictable to reliably trade with (unless you are doing long term investing, then that is a completely different strategy).

>Sparked a question in my investment circle that maybe powerful CEOs/heavy hitters are deliberately reporting weak outlooks to keep the prices falling, while they all accumulate millions of shares and profit when they report ridiculous earnings in the upcoming months to profit big time.  Is this a feasible plan for those kinds of people? 

Lol just no. Maybe a failing company who only will last a few quarters before going under, but not a top blue chip like AMZN, AAPL, etc...This would fall under stock manipulation and the SEC would be all over it. The amount of risk they would take for profit would not be worth the downside that would happen if they were caught withholding earnings information to influence the stocks movement. Not to mention the amount of records they would have to change to cook the books would not be worth the time and effort.

",
12091,2018-10-28,"> I mean in the case of GOOG/AMZN, there was literally NOTHING bad about their report, yet both fell still further.

This is simply not true. To quote an [this](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/record-profit-cant-save-amazon-from-stock-downturn-2018-10-25) article, ""More concerning for investors was Amazon‚Äôs forecast of sales in the fourth quarter ‚Äî the all-important holiday-shopping quarter for retailers ‚Äî of $66.5 billion to $72.5 billion. Analysts on average had been projecting fourth-quarter sales of $73.8 billion for Amazon.""

And to quote [this](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/alphabet-stock-falls-after-google-beats-on-earnings-but-sales-come-up-short-2018-10-25) article regarding Google, ""We‚Äôre seeing a larger than expected slowdown in Google properties‚Äô revenue, representing its core search business...""

There is more to stock price post-earnings than the actual EPS. Future forecast is significant. Take a look at Turtle Beach (HEAR). They **crushed** earnings a few months ago and have lost about 50% of their market cap since then.

Regarding Apple - anything could happen. My own personal belief is that they will beat earnings but have a shitty forecast due to the trade war with China. We'll see though... If both AAPL and FB shit the bed it could be very hard for the market to recover from.",

FOR TRADING August 23rd
Retail Rules the Day
 
The market started on the downside after overnight futures were weak, but nowhere near the lows on the Trump news.  Before I went to sleep around midnight the S&P e-minis were down about 17 but by the open it was closer to -5.  Almost from the start the DJIA was the weak sister, and as has been the case recently the bigger the index the better it did.  The low on DJIA was -100 and it closed -88.69 (.34%), S&P 500 -1.14 (.04%), NASDAQ +29.93 (.38%) DJ Transports -114.12 (1%), and the Russell +4.50 (.26%).  Internals on the DJIA were 22 down and 8 up with the bulk of the loss today centered in BA -27 DOW pts., UTX -19, TRV -16, and MMM -10.  The overall internals on NYSE were essentially even with volume 1:1, A/D 14:13, but new highs were 4:1.  NASDAW was much stronger with volume 2:1, A/D 3:2, and new highs 7:1.
 
SECTORS:
 
Other names in the news, the big news were more beats by retailers with TGT the star today finishing +2.67 (3.2%) after being lifted as much as $5.50, URBN also beat but got none of the love and with 4 upgrades based on the beats traded up to $52.50 finished $45.48 -2.26 (4.73%), SMRT (Stein Mart) reported a smaller loss and solid full year projections but traded from $3.19 down to $2.58 -.46 (16%), and last in the retail list was WSM, up from $58 this week is trading $68.45 +5.83 (9.3%). Also in the news was EXAS, maker of the non-invasive Cologuard test that it is in an agreement to market the product with Pfizer.  It closed +15.27 (30.5%).  This was a $6 stock 2 years ago.
 
BIO/PHARMA, today they were MOSTLY HIGHER with CELG -.56, BIIB +1.70, REGN +1.61, ISRG +6.45, ABBV +.06, MYL -.18, TEVA -.67, PRGO +.34, GILD +.50, VRTX +.86, BHC +.94, INCY -.10, ICPT +1.37, INNT -.01, and IBB +1.12 (.96%).
 
RETAIL was MIXED as earnings for TGT and WSM drove the group, but some of the names took a rest.  M -.51, JWN +.75, KSS -1.18, DDS +.33, SHLD -.03, JCP +.06, WMT -.28, HD -1.33, TJX -.70, TGT +2.69, DKS -.20, and the brands URBN -2.36, ANF -.08, RL -1.93, UAA -.20, LULU +1.85, NKE -.27, KORS -1.38, GPS +.08, and XRT +.03 (.06%).
 
 
FAANG, the group was MIXED TO HIGHER today with GOOGL +4.34, AMZN +21.72, AAPL +.05, FB +.83, NVDA +9.42(Andrew Left of Citron is calling for 20% decline), TSLA -.23, NFLX + 6.48, BIDU -.08, BABA +.60, IBM -1.05, BOX +.30(we bought the 9/27 calls @ $1.15 today and they closed $1.12 +.09) and XLK +.15 (.21%).
 
FINANCIALS, banks were LOWER with GS +.69, JPM -.23, BAC -.05, AIG -.39, C -.11, PNC -.71, WFC +.10, and XLF -.10 (.35%).
 
OIL, $67.86 +2.02 Oil was rocked by supply and drawdown numbers last week but after probing the lows for the past few days managed to bounce and spend some time defining the trading range.  Last night I said that I want to see some horizontal trading before making a commitment to the long side again, but today‚Äôs action was dramatic.   I will still have to stand aside since to get long offers no reasonable stop if I‚Äôm wrong, and I don‚Äôt want to get short a strong market.  There is still meaningful supply between here and $70.40.
 

There is also a solid downtrend to contend with.  I‚Äôm still ‚Äúsit and watch.‚Äù
 
The stocks were HIGHER with CVX +.86, APC +1.01, BP +.61, COP +1.11, APA +.83, PSX +.51, MCP +1.20, MRO +.74, RIG +.33, OAS +.52, HES +1.79, NE +.25, OXY +.44, XOM +1.13 and XLE +.96 (1.31%).
 
 
METALS, $1,203.30 +3.30 the gold failed to hold the round number of $1,200 and has traded as low as $1,167 before its current 4-day rally.  This prior support now becomes resistance and until we can rally AND CLOSE over $1,225 ‚Äì 1,240. Copper collapsed to contract lows of $2.55 and it has broken all support going back to May 2017 at $2.50, and it too has tried for a couple of days to rally back into the break-down. We‚Äôll need better economic numbers to get it started back to the upside.
 
BITCOIN closed $6,287 +230. After trading down to below test support at 6,800 we collapsed again hitting $6,110 before a minor rally to trade 6,615.  Tuesday‚Äôs low of $5855 is just $100 above contract lows of $5,755 could easily be breached and the overhead supply is still from 6,900 to 7,300.  Today we rallied as high as 6,880 and couldn‚Äôt hold and finished closer to the lows of the day.  I believe we will test at least $6,000 shortly.
 
Tomorrow is another day.

Anyway, I know big funds like Spy500 and QQQ are already made up of stocks like apple and Microsoft. I like having the bug funds for stability, but the individual stocks have gotten better overall growth. Is it unusual to double dip like that? Recommendations on what to do different?

I've got the same situation in my MJ stocks too.. a large chunk of that is the $MJ fund, then also individual holdings for CGC, TLRY, and others in smaller amounts.Is double dipping in your portfolio necessarily a bad thing?",

I am currently moving from trading companies on the ASX to companies on the NYSE and am trying to find the regulatory filings for director dealings. Can someone point me to where I can find the filings for companies such as MMM, NFLX and BA? Usually I can find them on the securities exchange website, but currently facing a lot of difficulty in navigating to the right location on its website.

Thanks allNew source for director dealings on companies listed on the nyse",
12112,2018-10-22,"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are NOT excluded from this report.

A long-running bull market in stocks may be about to enter its final inning.

Morgan Stanley reiterated its cautious view on equities, arguing that a ‚Äúrolling bear market‚Äù wasn‚Äôt yet over, and that it could soon impact the parts of the market that have been holding up successfully.

Specifically, the investment bank said that small-capitalization stocks ‚Äî which have benefited from the uncertainty surrounding trade policy, given [**their high levels of domestic revenue exposure**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-one-factor-has-determined-which-stocks-rise-or-fall-on-trade-war-fears-2018-06-21) ‚Äî could be about to turn.

Michael Wilson, Morgan Stanley‚Äôs chief U.S. equity strategist, said he was ‚Äúa bit leery about the fact that small caps have become a perceived safe haven in the event of trade conflicts,‚Äù and that this ‚Äúperception may now be overpriced.‚Äù

Small-capitalization stocks, as benchmarked by the Russell 2000 index[**RUT,** **+0.77%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/rut?mod=MW_story_quote) , are up 8.9% over the course of 2018. The S&P 500 [**SPX,** **+0.49%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx?mod=MW_story_quote) is up 5% this year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average [**DJIA,** **-0.03%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia?mod=MW_story_quote) is up 1.9%.

>*‚ÄòJust remember that those last innings can bring a lot of excitement and anguish, too, depending on which team you are rooting for.‚Äô*Michael Wilson, Morgan Stanley

The Nasdaq Composite Index [**COMP,** **+1.24%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/comp?mod=MW_story_quote) has been the best performer among the major indexes; it‚Äôs up 11.8% year to date. However, this is due [**almost entirely to outsize gains in a few huge companies**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-gains-in-2018-arent-just-a-tech-story-but-theyre-mostly-a-tech-story-2018-07-12), which have been enough to lift the index ‚Äî and by extension, have helped to support the overall market. Specifically, Amazon.com Inc. [**AMZN,** **+2.07%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn?mod=MW_story_quote) has jumped more than 50% thus far this year, while Apple Inc. [**AAPL,** **+2.92%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl?mod=MW_story_quote) is up 21%. The iPhone maker, the largest stock on the market, [**ended at a record high on Wednesday**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-updates-share-count-as-it-closes-is-on-1-trillion-market-cap-2018-08-01), boosted by strong quarterly results.

Not all of the market‚Äôs biggest drivers have had results on the level of Apple‚Äôs, however. Netflix Inc. [**NFLX,** **+1.81%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nflx?mod=MW_story_quote) disappointed in its latest quarter, and the stock has dropped 20% from its most recent peak, a drop that puts the video-streaming giant into bear-market territory, even as it remains up 76% for the year.

Facebook Inc. [**FB,** **+2.75%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb?mod=MW_story_quote) suffered its worst day ever in the wake of its results last month, and is now down 2.2% for the year, and it‚Äôs off more than 20% from its own all-time peak. The plummet in Facebook underlined how vulnerable the overall market could be in the event that [**further cracks appear in the uptrend of growth stocks**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/after-a-decade-of-wins-the-end-may-be-near-for-one-of-wall-streets-best-stock-trades-2018-07-30), which have lifted the market for years.

The so-called FAANG stocks ‚Äî a quintet that refers to Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Netflix, along with Google parent Alphabet [**GOOG,** **+0.50%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goog?mod=MW_story_quote) [**GOOGL,** **+0.66%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/googl?mod=MW_story_quote)‚Äî have by themselves contributed a sizable proportion of the overall market‚Äôs gain this year. All five are in either the technology or the consumer-discretionary sectors, and, as Morgan Stanley‚Äôs Wilson noted, ‚Äúwithin the U.S. market, we have noticed a significant divergence between the perceived weakest links and the stronger ones. From a sector standpoint, it‚Äôs really down to just technology and consumer discretionary \[maintaining strength\].‚Äù

‚ÄúOur call was that these groups are likely to get hit next and, indeed, we think a meaningful correction in these asset categories began late last month. The bad news is that these sectors make up almost 40% of the S&P 500 and close to half of the Nasdaq Composite Index, so the correction will leave a mark on the broader U.S. indexes if we‚Äôre right.‚Äù

He added, ‚Äúif we are right and U.S. large-cap growth stocks and small-cap stocks finally take their turn in the rolling bear market, we would view it as the final inning of the game we expected this year. Just remember that those last innings can bring a lot of excitement and anguish, too, depending on which team you are rooting for.‚Äù

According to Wilson, Morgan Stanley recently sold 25% of its large-cap growth position, rotating that into large-cap value strategies. In addition, the investment bank reduced its small-cap equity holding positions by 30%, putting that into cash equivalents.Bull market in stocks could be in ‚Äòlast innings‚Äô as bears set sights on strongest sectors",

FOR TRADING August 21st
DJ Transports lead the Way!
 
The market started on the upside and spent the day working a bit higher.  NASDAQ was the weak sister at the open and while other markets were rallying it spent the first couple of hours trading lower.  Around 12:30 it finally went positive and although not on the highs, managed a close of +$4.68 (.06%), while the rest of the indexes were DJIA +89.37 (.35%), S&P 500 +6.92 (.24%), the Russell +5.75 (.34%) and DJ Transports, the best performer +134 (1.19%).  Market internals were solid without being excessive with NYSE volume and A/D both 2.5:1 and NASDAQ just slightly less aggressive at 2:1 and 9:5 respectively.  The standout stat was new highs / new lows where the NYSE came in the big winner at over 6:1 while over at NASDAQ they were 2:1.
 
SECTORS:
 
Other names in the news, premarket we had the announcement of PEP buying SODA as its new entry into the bottled carbonated water paying $3.2 billion or $144/share.  This was just about 10% premium but don‚Äôt feel bad for holders since when the rumors surfaced 3 weeks ago the stock was just $85 so the real gains were closer to 70%.  In other news NKE got several upgrades based on solid inventory controls and more B to C sales (with much better margins) and finished the day +2.43 (3.05%).  TSLA took a pounding based on another interview that suggests the Elon Musk take a ‚Äúmedical leave‚Äù for a while.  The stock broke to $287 from its high just 9 days ago at $387, but managed to reverse its 6% loss from Friday‚Äôs close to manage a gain of 2.94 at the close.  A small name, SSC, a Chinese block-chain company got a contract to finance $24 billion to upgrade the buses from diesel to electric.  I have no clue how this works, but the stock closed $1.97 Friday and was trading $4.18 premarket and finished the day $3.02 at the lows but still +1.05 (53.3%).  Lastly, LCI, maker of several generic drug products received notice that it will not have its agreement with its main distribution partner, Jerome Stevens renewed in March 2019.  It was down early and at the close was $5.35 ‚Äì 8.15 (60.3%).
 
 
 
BIO/PHARMA, today they were MIXED with CELG +.51, BIIB -1.11, REGN +.54, ISRG +.44, ABBV -.29, MYL +.26, TEVA +1.43 (5.9%), PRGO +2.54 (3.48%), GILD -.68, VRTX -.92, BHC +.35, INCY +.25, ICPT -.04, INNT +.01 and IBB -.20 (.17%).
 
RETAIL was MOSTLY HIGHER as earnings for several are due tomorrow.  Today‚Äôs upgrades for LULU caused quite a stir and sent the yoga / casual clothing company +6.48 (5%) and with NKE‚Äôs upgrades this morning sent the rest of the brands flying, with RL +3.50, UAA +.75(3.6%), KORS +1.97, GPS +.89, ANF +.65, URBN +1.10 and drove the stores higher with M +2.08 (5.7%), JWN +2.51 (4.24%), KSS +2.47 (3.23%), DDS +2.57 (3.45%), WMT -1.77, HD +2.11, TJX +1.62, TGT+.46, and DKS +.70.  My two favorite terminal retailers were both down with SHLD -.08 (5.7%) and JCP-.12 (6.7%) while the retailer ETF was XRT +.73 (1.43%).
 
FAANG, surprisingly the group was MIXED today with AAPL making a new all-time high this morning @ $219.18 before closing lower on the day @ $215.45 -2.12The rest of the list was GOOGL +6.10, AMZN -5.82, FB -1.15, NVDA +2.72, TSLA +1.75, NFLX (its first solid day in a while) +11.55 (3.6%), BIDU +.93, BABA +3.32, IBM +.45, BOX +.73 (we bought the 9/27 calls @ $1.15 today and they closed $.94 +.21) and XLK +.07 (.10%).
 
FINANCIALS, were HIGHER even with the weakness in interest rates with GS +2.40, JPM -.35, BAC +.11, AIG +.47, C +.81, PNC +.33, WFC +.17 and XLF +.06 (.21%).
 
OIL, $65.42 +.21 Oil was rocked by supply and drawdown numbers last week but after probing the lows for the past few day managed to bounce and spend some time defining the trading range.  I have said that I want to see some horizontal trading before making a commitment to the long side again.  The stocks were HIGHER with the exception of CVX, down just .05.  all the others I follow were up and the XLE +.43 (.59%).
 
 
METALS, $1,194.60 +10.80 the gold failed to hold the round number of $1,200.  This was partially due to the technical but also the fact that like Oil, it is an international commodity priced in the rising US$.  Last Wednesday night the pajama traders took it as low as $1,167 -18 before it came back early Thursday morning.  The action last night and the follow thru today are just part of what I‚Äôll need to see before going back into this one on the long side.  Copper collapsed to contract lows of $2.55 and it has broken all support going back to May 2017 at $2.50, and I‚Äôll need to see more than an anemic rally. We‚Äôll need better economic numbers to get it started back to the upside.
 
BITCOIN closed $6,452 -20. After trading down to below test support at 6,800 we collapsed again hitting $6,110 before a minor rally to trade 6,615.  Tuesday‚Äôs low of $5855 is just $100 above contract lows of $5,755 could easily be breached and the overhead supply is still from 6,900 to 7,300.  Today was another narrow ‚Äúinside day‚Äù that I feel will send us down again to test the lows.
 
Tomorrow is another day.

Strong Transports Yesterday... premarket update 8/21",
12127,2018-08-09,"If you plan and to hold a your stocks until you die, invest in individual companies or be a trader, this is not useful. Lets get this clear, this is my opinion and most importantly it does not mean a particularly company is over valued it means I believe the market as a whole is overvalued.

1. Most basic point it. It has been over 10 years since we have had a real bear market. One is just kinda over due. And it has not like we have had the growth to justify it. The US economy has been slow to come back from 08, in comparison to other crashes. Not to say thats not understandable, 08 was much worse then other crashes, but the stock market has not reflected the lack luster growth.
2. Unnaturally low interest rates(and other underperforming assets) driving demand for US stocks. As you all know asset classes compete with each other.  People only have so much money to invest and if one class is giving good returns it draws capital to itself and away from other classes. US bonds have had low interest rates historically speaking. When 10 years are below 3%( which seems normal now) less investors are willing to buy, driving an increase demand for stocks. Furthermore, other stock markets have not been preforming very well. The ftse has only return 15% in the last 5 years. Shanghai comp is at 35% in 5 years.(not the best indicated as they had a MASSIVE bubble.) Dax and Nikkei have done better at 51 and 65% over 5 years. (S&P returned \~68% which means Nikkei outperformed S&P as yen is deflating while USD is inflating) Gold has not moved almost at all in 5 years. The only large asset class I see that has done pretty well is real estate, in certain areas( in some cities I think it has entered a bubble.) From what it seems to me most people are heavily into US equities as they are returning the best.
3. Cape ratio or the Cyclicly adjusted p/e ratio is a good way at judging what the average p/e on a stock is (in S&P).

[http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/](http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/)

As you can see we are at a pretty high evaluation. Your really not getting the bang for your buck currently. This could be explained by amazon using a different model of never earning money and keeping a very high P/E. (I don't think NFLX is the same, I think they are just overvalued) However, I don't think that alone would change it a lot.

4) Things I do not know but would like to.

How the massive popularity ETF changes this.

How stock buybacks changes this. (Is this even new? I have heard more and more companies doing this but I don't know if its a new thing or just something that got popular again.)

In conclusion: Could the market go to a higher level from here? Yes. However, I think we have a greater chance of going into a bear market from this point.Why I PERSONALLY Believe stocks to be overvalued.",
12128,2018-08-09,"The fact your first point says a bear market is ""over due"" tells me enough. You can't justify the need for a correction or crash just because of time periods.

I agree on your point about low interest rates driving more and more people to stocks, additionally with etfs the ability to have a cheap diversified portfolio is ever growing. However, these don't cause market crashes. Until we see something else effect earnings or employment that will effect the market, which can then be amplified due to the increased capital in stocks, a bear market won't occur. Which is why its impossible to predict. Maybe the trade war gets out of hand, or some disruption in the middle east. But the fact there are a lot of investors doesn't in itself pose any risk.",

12137,2018-08-09,"The best gains are in the first year of a bull market. The second best gains are in the last year. No doubt we are getting close to the end of this nearly 10 year old bear market. But as far as timing and profits go, there is a huge difference between peaking today and peaking two years from now. 

At the moment there is nothing to suggest the market is peaking today. That also goes for the next six months. We setting up for a rally into year-end, not a fizzle. (if we were fragile and vulnerable, there have been more than enough bearish headlines to send us tumbling, instead prices are holding up remarkably well) 

No doubt this market will peak at some point, but we need to start seeing worrying things in the economic data first. Peaking simply because it is time or we've gone too far isn't going to start the next bear market. ",

12139,2018-08-09,"I agree that ""over due"" is not an argument. I think it is just a way to alert people to the length of the bull market, as well as the fact it has to end. Might as well see if it should end. I don't think employment date is very accurate. They keep changing what it means to be unemployed. You can measure a distance if your ruler changes shape every time you try to measure. Also I think they way earnings are judged is a little weird. They have an analysts attempted to predict what the earnings will be(something that is basically impossible to do). If the stock ""outperforms"" the estimate it goes up if it ""underperforms"" it goes down. People could think earnings are good/bad based only on analysts predicting(see Facebooks 20% drop because of expectations on active users) I  don't think the cause of a bear market would be the US economy faltering or some geopolitical crisis, although that could certainly trigger it. I think that stocks are a higher price then they should be.",
12140,2018-08-09,"I think maybe it pumps up large companies marketcaps that don't deserve it, simply because they are in the top companies. That is my best guess.

12143,2018-08-09,"The problem is you never really know when the first and last years are. Judging it on economic data is basically just timing the market. Personally, I think the market moves more on perception then data. It is hard to know how people will react to new data. Sometimes you think something is HUGE and no one cares and sometimes the news is talking about something you see as small for days and days. I don't really know though. The only bubble I traded during was bitcoin, so I don't have a full understanding about how these things played out. ",

The case for higher wages are supply side econ as well, as the workers will go out and buy stuff. Which one is it? Are you pro or anti supply side?",

Perception is important in the stock market, but for prices to fall, we need the common perception to be that corporate profits will be lower next year. So far that is not the case. We need some kind of economic data/shock to get people to change their mind about profits next year for this market to fall. ",
12149,2018-08-09,"No doubt. If you think for example mining is going to have a bull run(complete random example), the easiest way to do that is to invest in a mining ETF.

12150,2018-08-09,"As long as profits continue to rise, so will stock prices -> I believe that there is a somewhat of an intrinsic value in a company and a stock price tends to travel towards the intrinsic value. Even though its impossible to have an exact number lets pretend a company is worth exactly 100$. Lets say they have a pretty good year, increasing earnings and the like, and the company is now worth 110$. However, people like what they see and value it at 115$ on the market. Next year the same thing happens and the company is now worth $120 and is $130 on the market. As you can probably guess this cannot go on forever, eventually it will return to its intrinsic value. In this stock profits can be good, but the market carries it away with irrational exuberance. What gets them to realize that the stock is not  worth what its trading at, I have no idea.  ",
12151,2018-08-09,"Agree completely. Get the one with the lowest ER that covers the area. No reason to have top 5 mining etfs, just ""best mining etf with least cost on capital"" ",

12153,2018-08-09,"What makes trading difficult is we are trying to predict the future. In your example, one person's prediction of a company's future intrinsic value is $110. Another person's prediction is more optimistic and thinks the intrinsic value is $115. If the market price is $113, one person would sell and the other person would buy. 

The above assumes pricing is based on company's performance. Occasionally we fall into bubbles where pricing becomes disconnected from the underlying company's growth and profits, and is based entirely on what we think someone else will pay for the stock in the future. That's when pricing and fundamentals diverge dramatically and this stock market is not at that point. Valuations might be a little rich, but they are not totally detached from the underlying companies like they were during the dot-com bubble. ",
12154,2018-08-09,"Yes, that is the problem of intrinsic value, there is no way of calculating it with any degree of accuracy. I was using it as an example as stocks could lose value, while earnings are still good, due to a increased price. I also agree we are not totally detached from valuations, we are not in a bubble.

# Who is Winning in Retail?

### Key Points

* Retail is far from dead.
* This earnings season has highlighted the strength of the retail industry.
* Specialty niche retailers have struggled.
* Large retailers with diverse products tend to perform better.

## The Death of Retail?

The death of retail has been a common belief among a lot of investors. Amazon and the internet had taken the retail world by storm, causing brick and mortar stores to shut down, and business to dwindle. The retail apocalypse was upon us, and it seemed like there was nothing big retailers could do to stop it.

I previously wrote about retail, more specifically, the fact that the XRT retail ETF had made new highs earlier this year. At the time, there was doubt the highs would last. Not because retail is doomed, but because trade disputes promised to raise the price of goods retailers sell.¬†

However, the trade rhetoric has largely gone unnoticed in the U.S. economy, and retail earnings are showing signs of a strong consumer.

News outlets, like Bloomberg, seem to consistently show one retailer doing very well and one doing poorly. This has led me to believe there is a divide in the retail industry, and it could possibly be exploited, if I can determine what is causing the divide. So that is the goal of this post.

## Industry Losers

The first step was to select the stocks. Large retail companies were chosen, such as Best Buy, Lululemon, Ross, and Nordstrom‚Äôs. These are national companies, and cater to a lot of the economy.¬†

The list of companies varies from discount stores to electronics to high-end retail. Overall, I looked at 20 stocks to try and determine which retailers were dying, and which ones were thriving.

Of the 20 stocks analyzed, only four were given a sell rating: JC Penny, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Gap, and GameStop. At this point, all investors know JC penny is failing. They have not been able to innovate their stores to attract a solid customer base. 

## GameStop 

Bed, Bath & Beyond and GameStop are specialty niche stores, and that may be their problem. GameStop sells video games, but now competes with several different Netflix-like options.¬†

Xbox Game Pass, EA Access, and Game Fly are all options for consumers to play video games, without actually committing to owning the game. Instead, consumers pay a monthly fee to play an assortment of games as they please. 

## Bed Bath & Beyond 

Bed, Bath and Beyond‚Äôs niche is in home goods. The problem is that this is all they sell. Consumers only go to the store for one-off home items, and not much else. People don‚Äôt need to go to a department store for their home every week.¬†

When they do want to, Amazon, Wayfair, and other internet based companies can provide consumers with their needs. Internet users can also use reviews to determine a good product. Retailers cannot provide this type of insight in store. 

## Gap Inc. 

Gap‚Äôs problems are not so easily identifiable. The company owns Gap, Old Navy, and Banana Republic. While Old Navy continues to grow, these stores are simply performing weaker than analysts expect. The sell rating is based on the reaction post earnings report.

## What Makes a Good Retailer?

### Discounts/Value

Retailers like Target or Kohl‚Äôs focus on saving money. Shoppers feel like they are getting a good value, and that may allow them to buy more than they otherwise would. Plus they have a large assortment of products in their stores.¬†

### Variety 

A consumer can go in looking for a shirt, but as they walk through the store they are surrounded by many other items. This can potentially influence more sales as the customer sees other products.¬†

In addition, the wide range of products is also convenient for customers. At Target, customers can buy milk and a t-shirt in one trip to the same store.

### Diversified Selection 

A variety of products is a characteristic of a good retailer, but so is a diverse selection of one type of product , such as clothes. Nordstrom‚Äôs is doing well, but they really only sell apparel. However, they carry a vast amount of brands and types of clothing, similar to Ross and TJ Max, but with a focus on high end fashion.¬†

When a customer visits their stores, whether it is the regular store or Nordstrom‚Äôs Rack, they are able to look through their vast selection and compare brands and prices. It provides an easier experience. This is also how Best Buy operates, but with electronics.

## Conclusion

Retail is far from dead. Large retailers, and consumer discretionary stocks in general, are pulling the stock market up. While it can be argued that Amazon has changed the way people shop, it could also be argued that consumers felt a lot weaker prior to the election of Trump. His election has been credited with the revival of ‚Äúanimal spirits‚Äù in the economy. 

Strong consumer confidence has brought people out to the stores to go shopping in person. More people are willing to spend their money, and retailers are reaping the benefits.¬†

Retailers that can provide a good value and convenience, are seeing better earnings and stronger stock prices. As long as consumers keep their confidence in the economy, these stores should continue to do well.

12164,2018-08-27,"Gap isn't losing.  They're making more money and beating expectations.  They dropped after earning but are still up over the last month.  They had a huge run-up to earnings.  

Edit: your entire description of them is super wrong.  Old Navy stores are performing better than expectations on the year.  Gap stores are worse and they are closing more of them and opening more Old Navy and Athleta stores.  Honestly, if you have no idea what you're talking about just don't write anything at all.  ",

12168,2018-10-01,"Hello Reddit! 

I have recently decided to embark on a journey towards day trading. I'm still in the 'information gathering' phase, and I've opened an account. Instead of doing things the right way (due diligence, paper trading accounts, any serious kind of technical analysis, screening, etc...), I bought 1000 shares @ **0.40$US**/share of a company called Tidal Royalty. They provide funding for startups in the American marijuana industry, in exchange for a % of the company's profits. I bought this because I got an emailed ""Alert"" from a company that claimed it may be the ""next big Netflix"" stock. So I used my ""gut"" (stupid mistake, never again!!) and spent 400$US. Since then it dropped about 50%, so I'm down 200$US. I feel gutted, stupid and never will I buy a stock based on hype, ONE article I read online, and with so much emotion. I wanted quick easy money and instead I lost 200 bucks. I did learn a valuable lesson however, and I'm glad I did so early and without having lost too much $$. I do feel like the article was just sent out as a way to influence dumb ""traders"" like myself. 

&#x200B;

With this said, does anyone have any advice for a young and inexperienced trading ""student"" (I wouldn't dare call myself a trader yet)? Also, what should I do with the 1000 shares I still have in this company? ANY advice would help!!!Dumb ! investor that made a stupid move :(",
12169,2018-10-01,Tbh this is the cheapest and most valuable lesson youll learn. Remember in day trading your first loss is your smallest,
12170,2018-10-01,"> does anyone have any advice ...

Sure. The title of your post says ""Investor"" but your post says ""trading"" and ""DayTrading"".

Are you an Investor or a Trader or a Day-Trader?

And if you don't know the difference, that's a good place to start and decide what is that you want to do with your money.",
12171,2018-10-01,"I'm the same kind of stupid. I also bought 1000 shares, but I paid 450. and it's now worth 190. This slide has to due with it being suspended for weeks now in the U.S. If it ever gets resolved we both may get our money back.",
12172,2018-10-01,"Judging by your post, I don't think you should be 'trading.' Do you have a 401k or an IRA set up already? If not, I'd say start with that first. ",
12173,2018-10-01,"I‚Äôm no expert and am very young into this myself. I personally have found the TD Ameritrade App/site to be extremely helpful. Just this past week alone, I have learned soooo many new things about what types of trends to looks for and how to set up your charts in a way that you, first of all, can understand but also has great information with execution points on where to buy/sell/keep. I‚Äôve also been listening to podcasts on my phone which go over many many topics (they keep it very brief but lay out enough info for you to process, understand a bit and then make the decision to look deeper into a specific idea or trading style). There is an absolutely INSANE amount of information out there and there is no perfect method but two things that I feel comfortable saying is this:

1) NEVER go off emotions...whether that be fear (cause you to sell to early) or what you mentioned. Let your numbers do the work for you. Put in your due diligence with making the proper charts, proper research and make the best, most informed decision you can.....based completely off of the system you set up. 

2) Volume!: Volume is a very strong indicator and there are many many different ‚ÄúVolume indicators ‚Äú to look at, but if there is one thing that is pretty dang straight forward, it‚Äôs that volume, rising/falling, go hand in hand with the movement in price. Then you have to add in crossovers and all kinda other shit, but you get the point lol

But please, I would LOVE to hear other people input that have a lot of experience. I could definitely use this type of great information!!",
12174,2018-10-01,"Like someone said before, being a day trader, trader, and investor are not entirely synonymous. Learn the differences because they all have their own nuances. Day trading is typically flipping stock within the intraday (from open to close). Robinhood by default has protections against that type of trading. Typically, going into it with investment in mind is a long-term hold and usually has long-term goals in mind. If you look at some of the investment [companies/brokers](https://www.wealthfront.com/), they have plans for retirement funds or paying things off, or paying into things. Trading is typically just trading. Whether it be calls, puts, naked, covered, market sells and purchases, etc.

Anyway, when did you buy the shares? You can't be freaking out on a weekend when nothing is moving, but also look at the news right now for them. Check their company website and see if they've posted anything recently. Dig around on news aggregates and see if you can find news on them. Do they have an earnings report coming up?

edit: also, you should use resources like https://finviz.com/ to watch for news on a specific company, trends, volatility, statistics, etc.",
12175,2018-10-01,U only lost $200 which you should consider yourself lucky...get a real education on trading and start by paper trading,
12176,2018-10-01,"You have already lost $200. And you have only $200 only on stake. I would suggest you hold. And for future don‚Äôt buy on whim. Watch the sector you want to invest for a couple of weeks. Read up on what moves the sector and keep tabs on that. Anyone who says 400% gain in 2 weeks is giving you BS advice. 

Knowledge is power.

US MJ sector is little unstable. Still there are some players who receive a lot of hype e.g MPX. These stocks might appreciate if legislation goes in their favor. Farm bill might help some players who have Hemp based business e.g. CVSI. And more states are joining MJ legalization. 

Day trading ain‚Äôt easy if you have 9-5 job. And not for weak hearted either. And don‚Äôt expect TLRY or BTC like gains. Managing expectation and capital is good place to start. 

Create a watchlist of stocks that people discuss and articles mention. Watch when they rise and fall. And make buying decision based on charts and data. Coursera has some good stock trading courses for free. 

Market on most stocks is overheated. So watch yourself. International events like Brexit offer good entry points. Some major trade war related news in future might offer you good entry point. ",

I really didn't want to sound like I'm ""special"" or better than anyone else just because I'm good at remembering shit.

12191,2018-08-08,Arizona Becomes First State In U.S. To Launch FinTech Sandbox ‚Äì Arizona recently launched the first FinTech sandbox of the United States. A FinTech sandbox is an alternative regulatory framework that allows the testing of new financial technology while still featuring regulatory control. The Office of Arizona Attorney General said that the sandbox has been built with the aim to explore different and novel ways for job opportunities and economic growth. This is the first time that such a development has taken place in the US. Blockchain and crypto startups can also test their ideas using this FinTech sandbox. But the startups can only get permission if they fulfill certain criteria. Startups and distributed ledger technology (DLT) companies must come up with a new FinTech service or a product if they want to make use of the sandbox.

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DqyqT0fWkAEiv0S.jpg

October was a rough ride for U.S. stocks, which despite regaining a portion of the month's losses Wednesday ended as one of the worst months since the financial crisis.

The S&P 500 lost $1.91 trillion in October, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices analyst Howard Silverblatt. Losses were spread widely across industry sectors. October was the worst month for the S&P 500 since September 2011.

""October volatility is legendary, and we're not just talking about the crash in 2008,"" Silverblatt told CNBC. ""October is a much more volatile month than any of the others as far as quick declines go.""

The month kicked off on a rocky note for stocks when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is ""a long way"" from neutral interest rates. Powell said the Fed does not need the policies put in place that pulled the economy out of the last financial crisis. He declared that ""we don't need"" the ""really extremely accommodative low interest rates"" the central bank put in place a decade ago. The Fed is likely to raise the federal funds rate to 3.4 percent before pausing, according to the most recent projections.

Big technology stocks ‚Äî most well-known as FANG: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet ‚Äî were among the hardest hit. Amazon ended the month down 20.2 percent, and Netflix ended down 19.3 percent. Investors fled both after earnings reports. Facebook and Alphabet finished October down 7.7 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively.

Do you think we have seen the end of this corrections?

Will big corrections be more frequent for the market in the upcoming years?S&P 500's monthly change in October was at 2009 levels",
12193,2018-11-10,"> Do you think we have seen the end of this corrections?

12194,2018-11-10,"Bulls and bears in a fight. Previous to 2018 SPX would gap lower then gap/melt up AND gap up and melt up.

As of Feb 2 2018 we gap lower and melt lower AND gap up and gap/melt lower.

I think the technical damage is done. Death crosses tests are forming in RUT SPX and NDX. Everyone is worried about China tariffs at $500 billion but I think a bigger threat to markets is the China real estate market at $43 trillion which is in free fall. $42 trillion is the value of 25% of the world's real estate. Let that sink in.

I'm short until Thanksgiving break at a minimum.",

FANG got wrecked this year - so far.

Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google parent Alphabet plummeted during 2018, compounding weakness that has plagued the broader tech space.

At least one of those names could have hit a bottom, according to Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak.

""The stock that I think could be compelling down here is Facebook,"" Maley said on CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Thursday. ""It's not a crowded trade any more. It's been washed out.""

Facebook is the only stock of the group negative for the year. It has dropped 10 percent in 2018, the bulk of those losses sustained after its notorious $120 billion drop in market cap in late July after its worrisome second-quarter earnings statement.

While Maley says the fundamentals in other FANG stocks might be more constructive, their steep run-up means they're more vulnerable to a pullback than Facebook.

""If the market begins to roll over, you're actually going to see the Googles and the Netflixes, some of that fast money, the momentum money, start to sell in a little bit of a panic move, but that money has already disappeared from Facebook,"" said Maley.

Do you think the sell-off is over in the FANNG stocks?

12227,2018-10-26,"So I still own the stock and bought it a while back before the 7-1 split... so I'm way ahead of it.  This past month got me worried with the big drops these past week.  I'm definitely keeping it for the long run and I think it'll be back up there, but what do you think it'll be at in say 5 years from now? Double what it is? Think holding it for that long is a good idea?Netflix stock",
12228,2018-10-26,"For a long term decision like that, don't make it based on price action.

Prices go up and down.

The only thing that should affect your decision to hold or sell is the strength of the underlying company.

So ask yourself, has netflix weakened? Do people still like netflix? Are their future prospects any worse? Questions like these.",
12229,2018-10-26,I believe this stock is more for short to midterm (months). I dont see this stock increasing long term. People get accustomed to netflix series. When netflix was released it was amazing. But now when I watch netflix I have to decide 10minutes what to watch because most things are not worth watching. Furthermore there are several competitors out there and the market is already quite saturated in the US.,
12230,2018-10-27,"Lol, double. Netflix is already overvalued. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that stock price is about flat over the next five years as they grow into it. Long term, though, they look good, like really good, so I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily sell. ",

Also, every TV and the majority of devices in the last 5+ years all have Netflix installed.

12232,2018-10-26,"Looking at the current landscape of streaming, its Netflix and everyone else. Amazon prime has nowhere the quality of content. Filmstruck just shuttered. Disney streaming will not have anything but G-PG13 rated movies/shows. HboGo is only used when GOT is running. And all these network/conglomerates getting into the streaming business are already too late. CBS all access give me a break. 

Households will be carrying max 2 streaming services and thats it. Netflix for the adults and Disney for the kids/PC crowd. Most of what Hulu offers can be picked up an antenna. 

I get that some people dont like the valuation, but whatelse is out there with the upcoming lineup and content. Netflix will survive and thrive.",
12233,2018-10-26,At the rate they‚Äòre racking up debt and the fact that most of their Originals suck? Doubtful.,

12235,2018-10-27,"Disney won‚Äôt have anything but pg13? What are you talking about. 

First of all Disney owns a majority controlling stake in Hulu. 60%. 

Secondly they own pretty much 80-90% of every blockbuster animated film in the past. 

They own the Simpsons! 

They will absolutely blow everyone out of the water. ",
12236,2018-10-26,I‚Äôm not sure I will keep Netflix once Disney removes all their content. ,
12237,2018-10-27,"Correct. The Disney streaming service will not have R-Rated content. R rated content will be on Hulu. source: https://deadline.com/2018/02/disney-streaming-service-launch-slate-star-wars-marvel-1202281846/

Maybe that will change but who knows.

I agree Disney is a power house. A lot of amazing content, but I believe people will choose a mature/dark/older whatever you wanna call it option (Netflix) and a kid/cleaner/sunshinny/whatever you wanna call it option (Disney Streaming). Hulu will get squeezed. Hulu will have the library of fan favorites but will they have the original programming that Netflix has been building for years. Original programming is where the growth it.",

12248,2018-10-17,They're supposed to be having some meeting or whatever about potentially raising interest rates at 2pm today. If they raise interest rates... prepare for a market tank which means TVIX will skyrocket,
12249,2018-10-17,It‚Äôs a competition in a way. It‚Äôs a Wisconsin thing.,
12250,2018-10-17,Ahhhh. Okay. I thought you meant it would plummet instead of skyrocket. Thanks for the info.,
12251,2018-10-17,"TVIX is the ""fear gauge"" of the market. If the market does poorly, TVIX goes up. So, if the fed raises interest rates, people get spooked",

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Friday, September 28th, 2018! :)**(9/28) - Friday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News",
12269,2018-09-28,"Final trading day of September and Q3 today. Hope everyone had a pretty good trading month and quarter.

What were some of your best winners for the month and quarter?",
12270,2018-09-28,"Right now I'm enjoying BB. Not much but I just started and I feel I made the right call, also OKTA",
12271,2018-09-28,Boeing and Microsoft over the past month. ,
12272,2018-08-02,Fang is fine except for Netflix!  Netflix is WAY overvalued.  Great article explaining why:   https://medium.com/p/5061974c38a6?source=linkShare-cc76544d437c-1533181722,
12273,2018-08-06,"FB and AAPL both trading under the S&P PE ratio average. Value buys. They both make insane amounts of money, have fantastic cash to debt ratios, and have several market leading products that they haven‚Äôt monetized yet. ",
12274,2018-08-04,"That‚Äôs the point. Get everyone used to using those services for free while fb pulls in money. When fb starts to fade and everyone is addicted to the free services, then monetize. Amazon is doing that. Google is doing it with YouTube and map.",
12275,2018-10-10,"Particularly   


Amazon  
Netflix  
Google  


They just keep going down and down and down.  


I don't follow these blue chips but any news on why?What on earth is going on with FANG?",
12276,2018-10-10,The stocks that rise the fastest in a bull market tend to fall the fastest in a correction or bear market. ,
12277,2018-10-10,"I‚Äôll say it until the cows come home. Netflix is not a tech company and never should‚Äôve been considered as one. A market cap similar to  Comcast? Give me a break. To hit Comcast‚Äôs revenue and profits it would literally need to grow over 10x it‚Äôs size its subscriber count. Literally impossible. There‚Äôs no diversification there like actual tech companies either. No live TV, no sports, no video games, nothing. Just a streaming app giving you mostly bad tv and movies. And competition is coming like a fully torqued punch to hit them in the jaw. 

It‚Äôs glory run is over and a pullback is happening. Facebook, the lowest of the rest of big tech, has 2x more profit that Netflix has revenue. ",
12278,2018-10-10,"The increase, and the likelihood of increasing, interest rates means that the cost or borrowing and current debt has increased. 
Investors are also looking at increased wages and low unemployment which increases the costs on businesses. The higher price of oil is also a concern because many facets of a business rely on oil. 
Because of these increased costs, Investors are concerned that the current business cycle has peaked and the economy is increasingly likely to fall into a recession. 
Because of this, investors are decreasing their positions in order to lock in profits before the upcoming round of quarterly reporting. If the reporting is optimistic, then they‚Äôll cautiously increase their positions. If not, they‚Äôll continue to selloff. ",
12279,2018-10-10,Just took a good look at 1 hr and daily charts for dji and honestly it looks like a massive bearish rsi divergence and would not be surprised to see further downside. ,
12280,2018-10-10,Overvalued.,
12281,2018-10-10,Netflix I would be worried about. Amazon and Google will recover. ,
12282,2018-10-10,"Everyones getting hit today. Maybe a bear trend? Not a big deal. My parents were talking about the interest rate hike...might just be some kickback coming from that. I don‚Äôt haven‚Äôt heard anything major.

But my aunt said it‚Äôs hard for her to get her credit card balance to 0 or something..so consumer spending will probably decrease...couple that with tarrifs and price increases you have two negative factors. 

But these parameters can be shifted so the bear trend if it is one should be transient.prolly a mix of interest rates...bonds are more attractive...tarrifs. 

Idk I imagine it takes a bit to change these parameters. So we could be here for a while.  Some would argue this is needed for future growth..some people would say that none of this matters and governments don‚Äôt need to hike interest rates. Planet money had a podcast about it called modern monetary theory.",
12283,2018-10-10,Everything's on SALE!,
12284,2018-10-10,"Amazon increased their minimum wage to $15, so that might be part of it. Mostly that treasury yields are increasing. Why take the risk of FANG stocks when you can earn 3+% essentially risk free with treasury bonds.",
12285,2018-10-10,FANG tech bubble popping! ,
12286,2018-10-10,Good one. üòÇ,
12287,2018-10-10,Do you think a recession could trigger building out clean energy?,
12288,2018-10-10,Gotcha. Moved some shares from NFLX to Amazon.,
12289,2018-10-10,Amazon also cut a lot of benefits- I don‚Äôt see the wage thing mattering much. ,
12290,2018-10-10,"Lol.

Keep enjoying your 3% buddy.

",
12291,2018-10-10,"I don‚Äôt think they depend on one another. What does seem to be a dependent relationship is a higher cost of fossil fuel and an increase in clean energy investment. The more expensive oil is, the more viable alternative energy becomes. 

It‚Äôs interest when you look back on previous recessions. Oil price seems to be more indicative of an impending recession. I personally believe that we were descending into recession before oil prices plunged to multi-decade lows a few years ago. I believe that because Saudi Arabia and OPEC dramatically increased oil output (along with already super low interest rates) US business was bailed out.  I personally don‚Äôt see a recession looming until oil prices are closer to $100 along with even higher interest rates, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that over priced sectors of the market won‚Äôt experience declines. ",
12292,2018-10-10,"Imo I‚Äôd start looking at playing defense.    Sure, we could stabalize and see another leg up- but 10 years is longer than average for stocks without a sizable correction.    Tax cuts and buybacks are likely keeping things up for now, but that (imo) can‚Äôt last much longer.    Either way in 10 more years we will be at new all time highs so it doesn‚Äôt really matter.",
12293,2018-10-10,"Agreed there. That being said it does hurt their bottom line in the next 1 or 2 earings reports a little. That being said, I think that move might actually save Amazon in the long run (specifically one's regarding the dispersion of stock to employees) ",
12294,2018-10-10,"I'm young and have less than 2% of my holdings in bonds - I'm not touching them anytime soon. For big institutional investors, pension funds and people retiring now/soon - it is very attractive because of the RISK FREE part. This is why they are shifting how their holdings are distributed. I personally am using this chance to average down some holdings. (Amazon, Square, and Tencent have been my focuses lately)
Just explaining the mindest of people that are selling their FANG holdings and driving the price down. No need for the condescension. As someone that had to even ask this question at all, I don't think you're in a place to be doing that.",
12295,2018-10-10,"Your buying bonds results in a 1% return after inflation.
Might as well put your money in a high interest savings account.

If you're young <25 I'd have zero dollars in bonds. Why even have any money in bonds if it's less than 2%?",
12296,2018-10-10,"As a response to your last sentence: I've made $55,000 in returns on a $194,000 portfolio in the last 11 months.",
12297,2018-10-10,"Glad your making money money man - everyone has in this market. I have a little in bonds for the steady cash flows in (I love monthly dividends, $O is one of my favorites) and as a slight offset for days like this. I've been selling off part of my bond exposure today, and will try and buy a little back later. Ultimately, I do it for the sake of diversification. I also personally only own corporate debt - no treasuries. The higher yield on things like HYS make it worthwhile to have a small holding.",
12298,2018-10-10,You‚Äôre not a genius lmao. A lot of people heavy into tech has made a lot of money. ,
12299,2018-10-10,I didn't say I was a genius. But I am rich. I also own two properties totaling $1.1 million 'LMAOOO',
12300,2018-10-10,Also I average between 3.7 and 4.0 GPA in university but honestly I'm not too sure what my IQ is...,
12301,2018-10-10,"You sound more like a prick than a genius. No one cares about your $550k houses, this isn‚Äôt a dick measuring contest. And if it were, you‚Äôd come in dead last. ",
12302,2018-10-10,You‚Äôre not rich. You‚Äôre moderaterly well off. The decently successful Investment Banker makes what you consider rich in a year. ,
12303,2018-10-10,You and tens of thousands of people every year across the country!,
12304,2018-10-10,My dick is around 7 inches long.. what are you talking about?,
12305,2018-10-10,"I'm 28.. give me time. 
Also I'm following my dominant purpose which isn't financially related. 
I could care less what top investment bankers make.",
12306,2018-10-10,"Thanks, you just told me I'm in the top 1%ish particularly of people my age.",

12309,2018-10-10,sure bro. Enjoy your 3.7 gpa  university studies degree lmao,
12310,2018-10-10,Keep trying you dunce. How much you worth? How much were you worth at 28?,
12311,2018-10-10,"What? I am in a second degree and average between 3.7 and 4.0; I don't know what you're talking about now..

Also what is your GPA? For someone this easily raged I honestly can't believe, like how you're trying to talk as if it won't take you a life time to hit where I'm at (not 7 years LOL) that you have the ability to emotionally regulate well enough to have an A- to A+ average on all of your courses.",
12312,2018-10-10,I‚Äôll let you know in 7 years when I get to that age. Imagine being a full grown adult having to front on reddit because you‚Äôre clearly unimpressive in person. Who the fuck brags about a 3.7 GPA lmao. ,

12315,2018-10-10,Thank you. Be sure to call me King Bigshot. Or your royal highness Bigshot. Be sure to bow when you see me.. or preferably kowtow. I like that.,
12316,2018-10-10,...oh you‚Äôre a /r/nofap poster. That explains it. ,
12317,2018-10-10,"I will. I mean, how can anyone resist the genius of a whole 3.7 points on a gpa and a couple of 500k houses. Like a young warren Buffett my dude ",
12318,2018-10-10,"You're 21.. I'm serious: you're a runt. It's comparable to a 14 year old trying to talk tough. You have no idea how comical it appears. You probably also have about $10,000 to your name. You and I both know that though you think you have big value, there is nothing backing it.",
12319,2018-10-10,"No one said my GPA was 3.7. & it's a house and a condo actually. One is full paid off and the other is a rental property.

I can't believe you're pulling out names like Warren Buffet. 

Compare me to you, not me to Warren Buffet. That way, your social status given how you're running your mouth will actually be salient and congruent rather than incongruent.

But honestly it's the inner child in you, I know you can't help it. All good.",
12320,2018-10-10,please continue. I know you sort of people need this to feel better. This is probably therapeutic for you and I don‚Äôt want to interrupt ,

What is on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/StockMarket?

**I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Tuesday, November 20th, 2018! :)**(11/20) - Tuesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News [Best viewed in Reddit Redesign]",
12332,2018-11-20,This is going to be an ugly day oh boy. Thank you so much for making this,
12333,2018-11-20,I see everyone beating earnings and markets in free fall.,
12334,2018-11-20,Amazing post.  Thank you!,
12335,2018-11-20,Why?,
12336,2018-11-20,"Trade war and scheduled fed interest rate hikes.  Double whammy of near constant daily bad news for the foreseeable future (ie 9-12 months).  

I‚Äôm holding my positions and buying on irrationally large dips like the Target dip today.  Its gonna be a killer holiday shopping season this year.  TGT, BBY, AMZN and TTWO are almost certain winners in the near term.",
12337,2018-11-20,What would happen if the fed stopped raising rates and us/China come to a trade agreement?  Would the market find a different reason to fall?,
12338,2018-11-20,"if a trade agreement is reached I see the market rocketing upwards albeit briefly.  I don‚Äôt see Trump or China backing down though.  I mean, I‚Äôd love to see an agreement reached but Trumps stubborn and China‚Äôs not going to suddenly upend its entire business culture for anything (by culture, I mean they don‚Äôt see anything wrong with collusion or IP theft - they see it as good business)

The Feds raising rates come hell or high water and to me that‚Äôs the bigger reason for the downward spiral.  Companies have had access to nearly free debt financing for almost a decade now and those days are gone and most likely will never return (which in the long run is not a bad thing).  When the price of debt goes up companies bottom lines go down.  

What we‚Äôre seeing is a massive rebalancing of investment away from stocks and into lower risk investments like bonds which have become more lucrative because of the fed rate hikes.  This isn‚Äôt, to me at least, a ‚Äònormal‚Äô correction - this is a tectonic shift away from stocks.

I expect to see a few more -500 days on the Dow over the next couple weeks followed by a swift entry into a bear market before years end.",
12339,2018-11-20,"So just like that, we will only trade down or sideways indefinitely, regardless of earnings or performance?",
12340,2018-11-20,"I wouldn‚Äôt say indefinitely but clearly earnings aren‚Äôt impressing anyone at the moment.  

I would expect a new normal to establish sometime after April or May of next year once folks have comfortably factored in the interest rate hikes and the trade war runs out of things to tariff.  I think its jan 26th for the last round of tariffs and increases and then the fed will hike again probably around feb-march - everybody will freak out again around those events and then a new normal will establish shortly after that.  

Personally I‚Äôm just strategically averaging down on some quality stocks (and some random gambles) for the next few months.  These next few months will present some great buys and if you have the stomach for it I‚Äôd look at setting some target prices that you feel comfortable buying at - for example, if AMZN hits near $1300 I‚Äôm buying more.  Or you could just pick some mutual funds that are tech heavy and have been hammered and buy those now and hold some cash to buy more if there‚Äôs another hammering.

12355,2018-08-06,"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-06/forget-apple-goldman-says-flagging-new-1-trillion-for-s-p-500](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-06/forget-apple-goldman-says-flagging-new-1-trillion-for-s-p-500)

Investors fixated on one 13-digit milestone last week, Apple Inc.‚Äôs value. But another trillion-dollar threshold is in sight and is more relevant to the bull market in U.S. equities, says Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

It‚Äôs the volume of stock buybacks that corporate America is likely to announce this year. The total for S&P 500 firms will jump 46 percent from 2017 to an annual record, according to an increased estimate from the Goldman unit that executes share repurchases for clients.

The new forecast highlights accelerating demand from companies, a sign that any weakness in stocks is likely to be met with unbridled corporate buying. While August has been one of scariest months of the year for equities in the past decade, it‚Äôs also the busiest in terms of buybacks, accounting for 13 percent of the annual total.

Now, with more than 80 percent of S&P 500 members done with quarterly financial reporting, most companies can boost discretionary buybacks, concluding a blackout period that typically restricts share repurchases.

‚ÄúInvestors should focus on a different $1 trillion number that will have a key influence on the market: total buyback authorizations,‚Äù strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note Friday. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the size of the company but the use of the cash that matters.‚Äù

With a year-end forecast of 2,850 for the S&P 500, a level that‚Äôs less than 10 points above Friday‚Äôs close, Kostin is far from being the biggest bull among [Wall Street strategists](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PB38C4SYF01T) tracked by Bloomberg. Yet he said that the growing alarm around equities, particularly tech stocks, is unwarranted.

At the end of last month, Morgan Stanley‚Äôs [Mike Wilson](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-30/correction-worse-than-february-is-building-morgan-stanley-says) predicted that declines in stocks such as Facebook was a precursor to a correction that would be more painful that the February rout. At the same time, strategists at Bank of America and Credit Suisse sent separate [warnings](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-30/credit-suisse-joins-bofa-in-warning-of-tech-stock-crowding-risk) about the crowding risk in tech stocks, particularly the FAANG bloc of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.

‚ÄúOur analysis leads to a different conclusion,‚Äù Kostin wrote. ‚ÄúTech is less of a ‚Äòcrowded trade‚Äù than many investors believe,‚Äù he said, adding the firm‚Äôs weekly data on hedge fund clients showed 26 percent net exposure to tech stocks. That compared with 25 percent for the broad industry positioning at the end of the first quarter, which declined from levels in 2016 and 2017.

Moreover, there is still untapped buying power left from tech companies themselves. While the sector has announced 40 percent more repurchases this year, their actual buybacks are up at only half the pace.

‚ÄúBy extension, significant potential demand remains for tech shares as firms look to complete their existing programs,‚Äù the strategists wrote.Forget Apple, Goldman Says, Flagging New $1 Trillion for S&P 500",
12356,2018-08-06,Directions unclear. Bought Proctor and Gamble stock with life savings.,
12357,2018-08-07,"Here's how buybacks work theoretically:

Say you have a company with 1 million shares of stock that have a price of 125, so 125 million total market value.  Assume the value per share is composed of 100 (company value) plus 25 cash that it plans to distribute. Also assume 10 EPS.

The company can pay a dividend and the stock will decline accordingly, so now for each share you have a share worth 100 + 25 cash.  The company is now worth 100 million dollars but shareholders have 25 million extra cash. P/E goes from 12.5 to 10.

Alternatively, the company can buy back 20% of shares outstanding (200,000) at the 125 price for 25 million.  There are now 800,000 shares still trading at the 125 price.  People who wanted to cash out and sell the stock got 25mn cash while the remaining shares are still worth 100mm (just as they were in the dividend example).  Shares are still worth 125 each. EPS goes from 10 to 12.5 since there are fewer shares outstanding. P/E goes from 12.5 to 10, same as dividend example.

The act of buying back stock doesn't inherently increase the market value of a company over the long run, but it will shift return from dividends to price return (capital gains) so will have higher share prices with less shares.  They are just a more shareholder friendly (tax efficient) form of capital distribution since the people who have to pay taxes are those who wanted to sell their shares anyway.  If you look at a chart of the dividend yield over time, it has been decreasing, this is partially explained by buybacks. http://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-dividend-yield/'

Although the number of shares decrease post buyback and EPS increases, you can't keep a constant p/e immediately before and after buyback - the reason is that the company is more leveraged so should have a lower P/E.  Another way of putting this is the company is valued as it's intrinsic value (future cash flows) + distributable cash.  The intrinsic value doesn't change just because the number of shares do.

Buybacks can also be seen as a way of increasing leverage (decreasing equity), and are bad only if companies underinvest in future growth prospects with good ROEs, or become too leveraged and are unable to meet short term funding needs in a stress scenario.",
12358,2018-08-07,"I like buybacks in the short run, but I really question long term health and natural cycles of the market with them. It feels like they can make things appear healthier/better than they really are... until they're not (crash?). 

Basically a buyback will drive a stock price up over time but as company sales wane, the buybacks will cease... what happens then? (correction?)",
12359,2018-08-06,Wow just like 1999.  This will end well /s,
12360,2018-08-07, Can someone explain what does this mean for an average individual with investments in stocks and ETFs and 401k?,
12361,2018-08-07,"Doesn't this mean that all the buy back that's driving the S&P 500 price is hiding an underlying problem? That the market doesn't believe it's valued at that price? One of two companies doing it could mean that they are performing well and want to boost their stock for holders, a whole industry doing it sounds like there is a systematic problem in there.",

12365,2018-08-07,thank you! very helpful ,
12366,2018-08-07,"See above - funding a buyback plan is an alternative to issuing/Increasing dividends and is actually less risky since a buyback plan has a fixed dollar amount and ends at a certain date, unlike dividends which shareholders expect to continue perpetually.  Buybacks have no inherent effect on a company‚Äôs market value. A downturn causing reduced sales would decrease the value of the company, but no more or less than if buybacks were involved or not.",
12367,2018-08-06,hmm?,
12368,2018-08-07,You gon be broke sun ,
12369,2018-08-07,"There is excess cash and not enough ways to deploy it. Notably amazon has not done a buyback because it has ample options to invest its generated cash through internal business opportunities. Business buying back stock, are just saying one of two things- our shares are undervalued or we don‚Äôt have a better way to invest our cash. That being said, Apple has minted about 100 billion from buying back its own stock, so I think Apple is an anomaly.",

# **Dow drops 200 points on worries about slowing global economic growth** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/09/stock-market-us-futures-lower-after-fed-decision.html)*
*****
> Stocks fell on Friday as further losses in oil prices sparked fears of a global economic slowdown, but the major indexes still managed solid weekly gains.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 201.92 points to 25,989.30 as losses in Caterpillar and Goldman Sachs offset gains from Disney. The S&P 500 dropped 0.9 percent to 2,781.01, led lower by consumer discretionary shares and tech. The Nasdaq Compositelagged, dropping 1.7 percent to 7,406.90 as shares of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet all traded lower.
*****
> The indexes recovered most of their losses late in the day. At its session lows, the Dow was down 308.31 points.
*****
> West Texas Intermediate futures fell 0.8 percent to $60.19 a barrel, after briefly breaking below $60 for the first time since March. They also fell further into bear-market territory, trading more than 20 percent below their 52-week high.
*****
> Disappointing data out of China also dampened sentiment on Wall Street. The country's top auto industry association said sales in China fell 11.7 percent last month, marking the fourth straight monthly decline. The Shanghai Composite fell 1.4 percent overnight. Caterpillar shares dropped 3.4 percent in the U.S. while General Motors' stock fell 2.4 percent.
*****
> ""The overall trend is definitely weakening,"" said Benjamin Lau, chief investment officer of Apriem Advisors. ""You're seeing it in some of the earnings.""
*****
> ""We're seeing more anecdotal evidence that the global economy is weakening from the bottom end to the top end,"" Lau said.
*****
> The weak Chinese economic data come as the U.S. and China engage in a trade spat that has been going on for most of the year. The two countries have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods as the U.S. seeks a better trade deal with China.
*****
> Comments from White House trade advisor Peter Navarro soured optimism about a possible deal between the two countries. ""If there is a deal ‚Äî if and when there is a deal, it will be on President Donald J. Trump's terms. Not Wall Street's terms,"" he said. Navarro's comments come ahead of a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming G-20 summit.
*****
> These sharp losses have rekindled worries about a possible slowdown in the global economy, which come as the Federal Reserve looks to further tighten monetary policy. The Fed on Thursday decided to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged, as was expected, but comments by the U.S. central bank suggested it was on course to continue hiking rates.
*****
> Although a statement released by the institution noted a moderation in business investment, it said the bank still expects ""further gradual increases"" in the prime lending rate. Traders had been on edge last month due to concerns over the Fed's rate hiking path.
*****
> But equities still recorded strong gains for the week, following a big post-midterm elections rally. The S&P 500 and Dow gained 2.8 percent and 2.1 percent for the week, respectively. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, rose 0.7 percent. This week's gains were the biggest for the Dow since the week of March 9, when it rose 3.25 percent.
*****
> The U.S. midterm elections ended with the Democrats taking control of the House and the GOP maintaining a majority in the Senate. This result was widely expected by pollsters and election experts. Under this government make-up, meaning a split Congress and a Republican president, the S&P 500 has averaged a 12 percent gain since 1928, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
*****
> ""We've got this 'yes, but' scenario, meaning things are good right now but a lot can still happen,"" said Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management. ""There's still some turmoil and some volatility keeping investors on the sidelines.""
*****
> On the earnings front, Yelp shares plunged more than 26 percent after releasing its latest quarterly results. Dow-member Disney, meanwhile, rose 1.7 percent on the back of better-than-expected results.

# Typical November Trading: Strength Early & Late

> As of the market‚Äôs close yesterday, DJIA was up 2.07% thus far in November. S&P 500 was higher by 1.61% and NASDAQ was higher by 0.96%. Small-caps, measured by the Russell 2000 were performing the best, up 2.96% over the first four trading days in November. Current gains are consistent with the historical trend of early November strength. However, historically early strength has faded after the fourth trading day. Election results coming in line with expectations has extended strength this year. Mid-month, from around the fifth trading day until the fourteenth trading day, has been choppy. From there until the penultimate trading day of November the market has historically booked solid gains. Recently the last trading day has been prone to more weakness than strength.

# Beyond the Midterm Elections‚Ä¶A Solid Rally Regardless

> Later today the first of the day‚Äôs election results will begin to trickle in and if history is any guide, the results will likely have a minor impact on the market. This is the ‚ÄúSweet Spot‚Äù of the four-year cycle for the market. In the following chart the 30 trading days before and 60 days trading days after the last 17 midterm year elections appear (NASDAQ since 1974). Prior to 1969 the market was closed on Election Day so the close on the day before was used. By 60 trading days after the election (approximately three months), DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ were all higher on average from 6.8% to nearly 10%.

> Digging deeper into the data, the following table shows S&P 500 performance 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months after the midterm elections since 1950. 1- and 3-months after the election S&P 500 was higher 82.4% and 94.1% of the time respectively. By 6-months and 1-year after, S&P 500 was always higher, although gains did slow after 6-months. The years the President‚Äôs party lost control of the House of Representatives are shaded in grey.

# S&P 500 Cumulative A/D Line Tracking Price

> We monitor all sorts of different breadth indicators in order to get a feel for how market internals compare to moves in the major market averages, and one of the most widely followed of these indicators is the S&P 500‚Äôs cumulative A/D line. The cumulative A/D line is simply a running total of the daily net number of stocks in the S&P 500 rising or falling.

> The chart below shows the cumulative A/D line for the S&P 500 (red line) and the index‚Äôs price over the last 12 months. At first glance, it looks like the cumulative A/D line has generally been tracking the price of the index during this period, but if you look closely, there are some key periods that are telling. Looking back at the late January through early Spring period, you can see that while equities sold off sharply in the initial leg lower, breadth held up relatively well. In fact, while the first bounce in February stalled out well short of the prior highs, the cumulative A/D line came close to making a new high. More importantly, though, when the S&P 500 tested the February lows, the cumulative A/D line didn‚Äôt come close to making a new low, and then the rally that followed, it actually made a new high well before the market. This was a key positive divergence at the time and suggested that the S&P 500 would eventually retake its prior highs.

> In the current period leading up to the S&P 500‚Äôs peak right up until now, we haven‚Äôt seen much in the way of divergences in either direction. Both the price and cumulative A/D line of the S&P 500 made new highs on the same day in September, sold off hard, and then in the ensuing rally retraced right around 60% of the high to low decline. Unfortunately, at this point breadth isn‚Äôt saying much good or bad. Looking forward, though, the key things to watch will be how breadth reacts if Friday‚Äôs decline is the beginning of a new leg lower, or what happens if the S&P 500 rebounds and makes a run for new highs.

> If you are a bull, you‚Äôll want to see breadth remain above the recent low on any retest of the lows in price or a new high in breadth ahead of a new high in price. Bears, on the other hand, will want to see breadth accelerate to the downside on any weakness and lag prices on any upside.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week ahead? Have a great week to everyone in here on this new week ahead!

*****

Have a fantastic trading week r/StockMarket! :)Get ready for the trading week of November 12th, 2018!",
12374,2018-11-11,Puts on garbage Tilray. Way overvalued. ,
12375,2018-11-11,This finviz chart hasn't been updated right?,
12376,2018-11-11,RGSE!! She‚Äôs gonna send it to mars before Elon and Tesla does ;)),
12377,2018-11-11,"8105 NVDA 250 calls 21/12 first thing that came to my mind, WSB?! 
Edit: date",
12378,2018-11-11,I played a call off the bottom of tlry at 90. sold when it got to 105 and bought puts. Ate all my fingernails when it rocketed to 140. and now im still sittin here at 108... been a long week.,
12379,2018-11-12,"So I was reading into this. It seems 70 million of the shares are held by privateers(?, Private company that can't sell into lockout is over) and only 17 million shares are publicly owned. I'm not sure how much of a drop that 17 million selling would cause but it seems the downside is somewhat limited due to the 70 million owned that can't be sold. Feel free to correct me if my assumptions/info are incorrect. ",
12380,2018-11-11,How bad is the IV on tilray.... lost $500 on Tilray puts when it rocketed to $300 and the puts went nuts. Wouldn‚Äôt touch it but interested in hearing about what everyone else is doing.,
12381,2018-11-12,"Well, Tilray has already had massive down days in the past, so it's completely possible. Also, anyone who has any sort of profit in this definitely wants to get out once lockup expiry strikes in January. I predict it's going to get completely slaughtered. ",
12382,2018-11-11,I think the problem is misinformation. It's not an Aurora. It makes CBD drops and small medical ointments. They dont sell cannabis. Aurora has 10 farms all bigger than the single farm used for tilray. It got swept up in this reefer madness and its bound for a return but an irrational stock can continue behaving irrationally. You can find videos of both stocks operations on YouTube. Watch one for tilray and it will make you laugh at a 10b valuation.,
12383,2018-11-12,Yeah I'm thinking Jan puts on this thing. Might buy MJ puts tomorrow and see how this week goes. I can't imagine any of these companies are going to post anything that justifies their valuations,
12384,2018-11-11,"Thanks for the info. I‚Äôm not trying to be a Pot hater but the whole thing seems so irrational. And the folks pushing it on Weedstocks can‚Äôt seem to be reasoned with, so in this instance I‚Äôll stay far away and hope that no one loses their savings thinking it‚Äôs the next Apple or google.",
12385,2018-11-11,I heard a commercial on the radio trying to sell people on investing in pot stocks to get rich. It's basically the new Bitcoin,
12386,2018-11-12,"There are billions of reasons why you‚Äôre wrong:

12388,2018-11-12,"Except it isn't legal federally yet and these companies have 20+ billion dollar valuations when they make 10 million or so. Just like Bitcoin. Sure, it probably is the currency of the future but that doesn't make it worth $17000/coin right now when no one accepts it. 

I can understand valuing companies like Amazon based upon future growth because they're established, successful, profitable, and making inroads into other sectors (legal sectors) but valuing million dollar companies as multi billion dollar companies when their product isn't even legal yet is probably a bad idea. 

Edit: forgot to mention that the article that info is from mentions a 57 billion dollar MJ market. TLRY alone already had something like a $20 billion dollar valuation. So one company is presently worth half of the future speculative value of the entire market? ",
12389,2018-11-12,"TLRY is overvalued, but not all marijuana companies are overvalued. 

My point is that it‚Äôs ridiculous to compare bitcoin, a purely speculative currency more akin to an experiment than a good or service, to a 57 billion dollar market focused on a plant with medicinal and recreational qualities. 

A few of the marijuana companies are going to dominate that 57 billion dollar industry, and the market is growing at an accelerating pace. 

While it would certainly help, it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt really matter if it‚Äôs currently legal at a federal level for at least a few more years. As long as states will play ball, these companies will find ways to profit. If anything, they‚Äôre keeping away competition for a few years with red tape. 

",
12390,2018-11-12,"The market isn't 57 billion yet. The entire article you posted was about how it may be that much one day. 

One of those crypto currencies may end up being ""the one"" also. 

Either way, investing in MJ companies that are well beyond any reasonable valuation is no different than investing in crypto that has no real valuation. At some point you're just speculating and hoping you hit it big. ",
12391,2018-11-12,"It isn‚Äôt 57 billion yet. That‚Äôs why I used the future tense, ‚Äúgoing to dominate,‚Äù but it‚Äôs already a billion dollar industry. 

I still think that‚Äôs an unfair comparison. It‚Äôs not entirely speculative to value a company that sells weed. It‚Äôs difficult but not even close to being on the same level as crypto currencies. ",
12392,2018-11-12,"""It's a billion dollar industry...""

CRON: $1.5B market cap with $7M in revenue.
TLRY: $10.15B market cap with $27M in revenue.

Like I said, billion dollar industry with numerous companies valued at well over a billion dollars. Some of them are going to have to eat shit. Or at least their stock price will. ",
12393,2018-08-26,"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

The United Kingdom and the officials from the European Union extended the finalization of Brexit terms for the third time yesterday, admitting that the divorce terms will not be ironed out by October. The original informal deadline was in June, which was then extended to October, which is now being extended to November, which eventually will be extended, probably, several more times until the deadline runs very close to March 29th, 2019, the date that Great Britain actually leaves the European Union, deal or not.

I have 750 shares of NFLX @ 367 that I didn't sell on time because I thought it was accumulating before a breakout. It was about $12K in profit, and now it's down $35K or 13%. Fuck me!

Also holding 48 AMZN @ 1904. I was accumulating a bit when market dropped on Friday. I always liked AMZN but this still hurts. Down $8k or 9%.

I hate listening to market analysts. They are all assholes playing on the downturn and their predictions are fucking horrible. Fuck them!

I think what's bugging me the most is that I would never come back to this $140K level. I always considered this my ""looser"" level, as in no matter what I do I always just stay here. Getting here today is surreal to me.

I need to vent. Just need to vent. Feel free to post your sad or happy story, and your plans for the next few days.

EDIT 2018-10-11 - Rode it up a bit and closed at a loss. Have to eat this and move on. I am worried about earnings, guidance, and election. Will probably start adding back a bit after earnings if guidance for 2019 is not horrible. Venting",

Say you buy Amazon at $2000, and the worst drawdown you are willing to accept is 20%. Then you buy put options for $1600, and no matter how low Amazon goes in a sell-off, you can sell your shares for $1600. Your downside is limited.

That hedge does cost a little money, though ‚Äî the premium on the options. So you can make some/all of it back by selling call options at, say, $2400. Then if Amazon goes above that price by the option's expiry date, someone will pay you $2400 for your shares. If it doesn't, you just keep the money and your shares.",

12486,2018-09-25,Except when you have an iphone you never use google maps ,
12487,2018-09-25,You'd be surprised what $200 billion can buy you.,
12488,2018-09-25,I heard that Apple was going to combine their streaming service with TV channels and perhaps music streaming. Something tells me that with these platform plays (like Amazon) they are just using the original content to get people to sign up for the free trial. What they really want is for people to build a habit of using their platform and then get lost in it.,
12489,2018-09-25,Weird how Google Maps is the number 1 navagation app on iTunes app store since forever. Why are people wasting space on their phone if they dont use it?,
12490,2018-09-25,What‚Äôs to buy if nothings for sale?,
12491,2018-09-25,Google Maps is #1 because Apple maps is already installed on the iPhone.  I remember Apple saying that Apple Maps on iOS has more usage then Google Maps.,
12492,2018-09-25,Everyone has a price. Or should I say every movie/TV show does,
12493,2018-09-25,Yeah all new unowned originals rights are up for sale. Netflix buys a lot of it for themselves.,
12494,2018-09-25,"Unless you can pay out a price to Disney or Warner that convinces them to suddenly change their streaming plans, there‚Äôs not much out there. CBS is out too. What‚Äôs left? Fox will be absorbed into Disney. Universal and Sony left? Maybe paramount? Not great. 

They‚Äôd have to pay out licensing fees that equal to the revenue that Netflix or Hulu would be bringing in. And that‚Äôs billions and billions of dollars per year. 
",
12495,2018-09-25,"Most of those are shit. Netflix built its name on the major production studios, not indie throwaways that nobody watches. Now they buy those out to fill out their service so it doesn‚Äôt look like a barren wasteland. ",

12500,2018-09-25,"hmmmm......

Yes Apple has done so bad in new sectors....

iPod. New to the music hardware business.

iPhone. New to making phones.

Watch. Apple Music. Airpods........App Store...I can go on and on.

12505,2018-09-25,"Your first sentence, by the way, should tell you everything you need to know about Apple. Hardware, Hardware, Hardware. They are entirely hardware. 

And when they tried to push hardware into the streaming tv world....flop. Apple has never and will never be an IP/Content leader. It‚Äôs not who they are, and never who they will be. And now they‚Äôre trying to move into IP, in an area they failed with in hardware? Sure. What a great plan.

Apple Music is hardware? LOL?  App Store is hardware? 

AppleTV didn't flop. They've sold tens of millions of units. Of course at $199 they won't sell as many as those $19 Roku units. Apple isn't into sell cheap stuff.  Even at that high price they sold 25 million AppleTV's as of 2015.

https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/9/8164357/apple-watch-event-700-million-iphones-sold

Pretty sure they double that to 50 million units by now.  Apple could have easily made a $19 streaming unit and be neck to neck with Roku and Fire Tv. But they won't. The same reason they don't sell $200 iPhones.

I'm not saying Apple's movies/shows will be better than Netflix/Amazon/ect.  But to dismiss them entirely is a huge mistake.",
12507,2018-09-25,"Ios and MacOS is the exact opposite of innovative software rofl. 

When more than 75% if your revenue comes from IPhone and Ioad sales, you‚Äôre a hardware company through and through. The best in the world yea, but a hardware company all the same. ",
12508,2018-09-25,"Nah bro.  People buy iPhones for iOS and Apple's ecosystem just as much as for the hardware.  Android phones can pretty much match iPhones on hardware. But so many still choose to pay a massive premium because of iOS.

Just because Apple sells a bundle of hardware and software together does not mean they are not a big software player.  Apple's software/services businesses are probably worth over $400 billion.",
12509,2018-09-25,How can they be worth over 400 billion if they account for 20 billion in revenue lol,
12510,2018-09-25,"iOS is packaged with the iPhone.  Alot of the value of the iPhone comes from iOS and Apple services ( Maps, Siri, iMessage, ect). 

Apple has way more then 20 billion in annual services/software revenue.  For FY2018 Apple will have close to $40 billion in services revenue alone.  This does not even include the value of iOS or MacOS.   Last year Facebook had $40 billion in revenue as is worth almost $500 billion.

iMessage alone is worth a TON.  Whatsapp was sold for $19 billion. iMessage is worth DOUBLE at least.",
12511,2018-08-07,"I am unconvinced in the idea that when DIS finally enters the streaming game they are going to destroy NFLX.

1) The main strengths of DIS streaming services, live sports and cartoons for kids, are both valid core offerings. However both are niche compared to the varied tastes of the average consumer who just wants lots of varied content.

2) I believe hardcore live sport stream services already exist or will soon exist to satisfy that segment of the market

3) Serving up 100M viewers at once as NFLX does it a big technological achievement done entirely through AWS. I assume DIS will try to have a similar microservices cloud based architecture. However pulling this off successfully is a monumental task that requires software engineering expertise. NFLX has this and DIS does not. 

Full disclosure: I recently took a long position in NFLX (BTD) and am wondering how others feel about the stock and the DIS threat.Is DIS really going to eat NFLX‚Äôs lunch with it‚Äôs streaming service?",

Disney creates a crazy amount of content (everything from princess to marvel movies, the entire star wars franchise, TV shows, ABC, cartoons, radio stations, games, etc.), and they can tie it in with physical attractions (amusement parks, cruise ships, stores, toys, hotels).  They can refuse to license any of this content to Netflix, and they effectively have copy-write on their characters in perpetuity.

Disneyland makes more money per visitor than ANY other attraction in Southern California; a place with a lot of things to see.  There's not even a close 2nd that has anything near the size and scale.

edit: Disney could also decide to compete with some of Netflix's and HBO's content, purchasing the rights to produce it before they do. ",

On what point I do disagree with you. In 2012 it was pretty impressive that Netflix could do that streaming but now it is pretty ordinary. Think about Networks like HBO and Showtime. They have no technical expertise but were able to outsource the tech side to a company that has no problem dealing with it.

I think Netflix users will continue to grow - just who knows if it will grow fast enough to keep up with the PE ratio!

Who is their target audience? Children and families - a demographic that Netflix only casually targets. Disney is moving into a niche where it can cater to children and their families with family friendly programming. We are talking Star Wars: Clone Wars, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, and whatever else Disney stuff kids watch. Plus they will dump their Marvel/Star Wars movie content here as well. Then you have to think about all the Disney classics that will be put on their + the live action Star Wars show to come. 

Any adult content will get dumped in Hulu which they now have a 60% stake in. Will they hurt Netflix? Yeah, some. However, they are going to attack the market that has been neglected. 

Do you know parents? I guarantee they'll pay $10 a month to throw baby Sally in front of the TV to get her to shut up for a couple of hours while they can get some peace and quiet. I know I personally will subscribe day 1 because I love star wars and I don't even have kids.

But Disney will also have all of the Fox properties so does that mean Disney streaming will be exclusive home to Simpsons, Family Guy, all of the FX series, Spiderman, X men, Deadpool, Avatar, Aliens, Predator etc?

12558,2018-10-29,"Hello!

&#x200B;

With all this uncertainty in the market and the wild fluctuations we are seeing - I don't think right now is a bad time to invest in Disney. 

&#x200B;

Why? 

&#x200B;

1.) Check it's 3 month performance - it's been immune to this crazy ride we've seen over the last few months and has endured just fine with October's correction/borderline correction. When the market does well it'll ride to the $116-119 mark and when it all goes south it'll hit the floor of $110 at worst

2.) Not terrible dividend - not much to say on this - it's not great but you can count on them not cutting it

3.) Streaming service - it's going to be a hit and will A) capture an untapped market in streaming for children. Netflix has tried it but too little, too late, most parents with children complain that they simply don't have enough offerings to keep their child entertained exclusively, Disney will be able to do that. B) They will have majority ownership of Hulu and can pump family offerings to their Disney service, Adult offerings to Hulu 

4.) Diversification - they are going to have income streams from many different avenues (ESPN - Streaming - Disney Parks - Box office - Toys - Cruising) 

5.) Last but not least, a mote - No one can become the next Disney. The brand is simply too strong with too many diversified products that cannot be duplicated  - they will be here for the long-term

&#x200B;

I'm biased because I am long on Disney and it's my 2nd largest holding, but I do believe in this turbulent market they are a safe buy and you can use it to hedge your portfolio from the loses we are seeing. The million dollar question is going to be how they do in the next recession (not arguing when it's going to happen, but just that it will happen eventually) Disney didn't do so hot in 08-09 but I hope this time they are diversified enough to protect themselves from slumping consumer optimism. The question will be will consumers continue to pay streaming subscriptions or will they cancel them to shrink the budget. 

&#x200B;

Thoughts? $DIS - immune to market sell-off and a good time to invest",

12579,2018-09-26,"[Elastic](http://elastic.com/), the provider of subscription-based data search software used by Dell, Netflix, The New York Times and others, has released some more details on it's IPO. 

**Updated Information:**

* Elastic is looking to raise somewhere between $193m and $203m worth of shares. 
* Price range between $26 - $29 a share. 
* 7m shares on offer.
* Elastic will have over 69 million shares outstanding after its IPO. That values the firm between $1.81 billion and $2.02 billion. ~9.5x the amount they're raising.

Still no word on IPO date, but given the timing of this amendment to their S-1, I'm expecting sometime during the fall.

Link to updated S-1 is [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1707753/000119312518280418/d588632ds1a.htm).

What I proposed profits in the 200-227 range to offset the long, ",
12621,2018-11-17,Depends on yer time frame and amount of available monies at the moment. If i had shares and time - and money - I‚Äôd buy the puts and hold the shares - sell covered calls to morons since they‚Äôre unlikely to rocket up in the next month. When you sell the puts it may offset your loss depending on how many shares you‚Äôre in.,
12622,2018-11-17,"Well, when you say it profits in the 200 -227 range, you mean that it hedges your losses on the long in that range, and below 200 you're unprotected again. What I proposed leaves you with losses in that range but you actually *profit* below 200 and above 235 (not exactly, those need to be adjusted based on the cost of the spread, but you get it). 

Your position is a true hedge against a small correction, while mine is a hedge against rise in volatility which is direction-agnostic. My thinking is that with tech stocks as volatile as they are right now (See AAPL, NVDA, FB, NFLX), you're better off having protection against significant moves as opposed to protection against a 3-6% correction. You also have to consider the expiration of the options--if you're looking at long dated contracts, your zone of losses becomes much smaller if the stock makes big moves in the near-term. For example, if you buy 2 yr puts, your zone of losses may be between 210 and 230 come January 2010 (again, making up these numbers on mobile). 

If you tell us where you opened your long position and how many shares, I can give you more solid numbers when I'm near my PC, but if you have think or swim, you can also just use the ""Analyze"" tab to see a chart that makes it pretty easy to understand.

Edit: Forget everything I said. I just looked at ADBE and the IV is already relatively high compared to its 1 year range so it's too expensive for a backspread. Your original strategy makes more sense in this case.",

Basically the bet is it won't fall below 200, sonyiu sell those outs and collect the premium, this offsets the premium of buying the higher puts.

You could leave off the 200 sell and have more profits if it keeps falling, but then your net cost for the original puts are the rate they are being sold at.. so then profits would inly come from 225 and below (this is assuming the 235 is 10 and the 200 collects 2)",
12624,2018-11-17,"See my edit in the last comment, but I think you're missing something FYI. If you have a long position open, you are not profiting at all on the downside with your strategy, you are only hedging losses. For every $1 if falls below you $230 put, you lose $1 x number of shares on the long position (I assumed 100) and gain $1 x 100 shares on the put option, so you come out net breakeven. For you to turn a *profit*, you'd have to have options that control 2x the number of shares that you have in your long position. 

I'm not saying you need a profit on the downside, just clarifying that your strategy doesn't give you any since you mentioned it does several times.",

The idea is to hedge the losses and keep my position long if I think it can get back to the cirrent levels ..

If it does, the long gets back to even and j still have the profit on the short... If it doesn't I'm net even.

* Losing $50M on $150M of revenue (-33% net margin). In line with Twilio and Mulesoft. MongoDB was significantly worse at -60% net margins.
* We'll probably see a valuation of ~15x the proposed amount they're looking to raise.

12673,2018-11-26,"Hi everyone! I posted this for /r/dataisbeautiful recently and thought you all might appreciate it here as well. I took 10 years of quarterly income statement data from the major FAANG companies and used EchartsJS to visualize it in 3D. I had a lot of fun learning this charting tool and it's pretty interesting to see the relationships between all these items in three dimensions. For example, it's very easy to see the cyclical nature of AAPL in their revenues and costs, and also very easy to see the cost of revenue/revenue relationship differences between GOOGL and FB which don't have a ton of overhead, vs the same relationships for AMZN and NFLX which have very different margins. 

Anyway, take a look! If nothing else they're cool to look at! Next up, multiple companies on the same chart I guess!

About a year ago I sat in on a discussion about HR decision-making at Netflix, some of which was very interesting. Managers are encouraged to regularly reflect on the question ""If this employee showed up in my office with an offer $X better than their current salary from some other company, would I offer them the same raise to keep them?"" If the answer is yes, just send them an email and give them the raise. It improves efficiency, lowers turnover of top talent, and makes the engineers happier to just not bother with negotiation. Managers lead unprompted with their final and best offer and don't face pressure to keep salaries down. On a similar note, managers are encouraged to regularly reflect on the question ""If this employee came and told me that they were leaving the company for some reason, would I be ok with that? Is this person replaceable?"" If so, fire them. No need to go looking for excuses, not being incredible is a perfectly good reason to fire. Netflix legitimately aims to have no average or below average engineers working in the entire company.

Yes.  ESPN/ABC has *major* *major* headwinds.  Bob Igor had to go on an absolutely ridiculous spending spree during his time as CEO just to plug the leaks and maintain 7-8% top line growth.  Not many better CEO's out there compared to Bob, so when he's gone in a couple of years, how can we really expect the company to continue to outperform benchmarks?  It's going to be very tough.

There are 5,000 analysts in concrete buildings in capital cities around the world looking at DIS every minute of every day.  The fact that you, a simple retail investor w/out any knowledge or experience in financial markets, thinks DIS is undervalued vs. the collective power of the former crowd isn't exactly compelling.  

> Netflix market cap ... with P/E of 133!

ok.  let's repeat after me:  trying to compare PE ratios in a vacuum is a completely MEANINGLESS exercise.  

you do realize that DIS and NFLX have commanded these PE's for about the last 4-5 years, yet DIS is flat and NFLX is up around 500% ...  If investing was as simple as ""LOOK AT THAT PE THO"", then all of us would be trillionaires.

12848,2018-08-24,"BECAUSE THEY'RE DOOMED!!!!!!!!!! 

/s

",
12849,2018-08-24,"I have no idea what some people are writing. Much of what they said have nothing to do with P/E at all.

1) You can‚Äôt compare Apple‚Äôs P/E with Google. They are entirely different companies. Nor should you compare Apple with Netflix. Microsoft is a decent comparison. For reference, only compare the P/E of similar companies. I‚Äôd compare Facebook with Google and Snapchat with Twitter, etc.,

2) P/E simply stands for price/earning. This is the formula from EPS (Earnings per share) - which is earnings after dividends/outstanding shares. So if Apple had earnings of $1,000,000 and preferred dividends of $100,000 for their 10,000 shares, their EPS would be $90. Meaning, each share earned $90. P/E is simply the price of the share/EPS. Using the same example, assume the price of Apple shares are $1,000 and the EPS is $90.  This gives a P/E ratio of 11.11 - which is very low and can mean several things. 

3) A high P/E ratio can mean the company isn‚Äôt generating enough earnings. Some companies, like Netflix and Amazon, are aware of this and investors ignore their P/E because they both grow at a rapid rate. If you are investing into a high P/E company, you need to check if they are experiencing high growth. A low P/E ratio on the other hand can mean that the stock is undervalued (because the lower the P/E, the less you are paying for every dollar earned). On the other hand, you want to check if the company is growing. If not, there may be no movement in the share price because investors are unsure of the company. Simply looking at the P/E ratio is useless if you do not understand growth within the company. Ideally, what you want to look for are low P/E companies that have high growth. Remember: Stocks drop in value for various reasons. That 100% has a large effect on the P/E ratio and that is why stock screeners are used when looking for potential dips in a stock.

4) If a stock does not show a P/E, then it‚Äôs due to it suffering a loss. You will only have a P/E if you generate earnings. Just as I mentioned before, You want to look at comparable P/E‚Äôs of companies in the sane industry. But that is not all: Let‚Äôs say you want to compare BABA with Amazon. There is more at play than P/E. Political indifferences, growth, leadership, trade conflicts, etc., are all concerns you need to account for.


To summarize: Apple has a lower P/E ratio because they generate a lot of earnings and because of this, their shares seem undervalued. You want a lower P/E because it signifies how much you are paying for every dollar generated. Ex: Would you rather pay $20 for $1 earned or $15 for $1 earned? On the other hand, maybe their shares are valued the way they are because growth is declining, iPhone sales are less than projected, and maybe Macbook sales are down. It‚Äôs tough to say but this is where you have to insert your own level of strategies and make a decision. ",
12850,2018-08-24,"Slightly off tangent question. Isn‚Äôt PE kinda arbitrary because the price of a stock depends on how many shares too? My company could be trading at $100 per share today, but tomorrow my stock splits. Suddenly my PE just halved.",

1. Their annual revenue is growing below at 7%, which limits their futures earnings potential. 
2. Their revenue is very contingent on the success of major product launches. They even showed negative revenue movement on a full year basis (2015 > 2016). 
3. They're losing smartphone and tablet market share. 

They're printing money, but p/e ratios also reflect what investors think the company will be worth in the future. Netflix is growing faster, releasing quality products (movies) very frequently at the moment, and gaining market share --> hence, their higher P/E ratio. ",
12854,2018-08-24,"The answer is simple; their business advantage is less strong than other tech companies.

So there is value there even if they never move out to PE of 40 because their earnings growth has historically been that damned good.

AAPLs stock price doubling period isn't much larger than AMZN. They just did all that while always having the profit to back it up. Essentially Wallstreet has bet continually for about 10 years that this is it for AAPL and earnings growth in serious numbers cannot possibly happen. At this point AAPL has consistently defied that expectation with a begrudging upgrade.",
12860,2018-08-24,"Which isn't necessarily wrong.

Apple makes a high quality product, but there's no denying that it's also a status symbol. 

Apple is never going to implode overnight, or from one bad release. But a bad release *could* start the slippery slide to losing its social status as the premium product. 

Or their ""walled garden,"" and ""it just works"" approach could end up becoming a liability in the same way. Right now, it's viewed as a selling point - but what happens if management makes a bad decision and the walled garden doesnt adopt the next big thing (video format, etc)? Suddenly it could be seen as archaic and needlessly restrictive. 

It may not sink the company overnight, but losing its status as the premier brand would crush the company's value.

In 2017, on the worldwide cellphone market by total devices in use as reported by trendforce

Samsung had 21.9%
Apple had 15.2%
Huawei 10.8%
Oppo 7.6
Vivo 6.6
Xaiomi 6.4

Two things. 1. These data are much different in the US where the bottom four Chinese manufacturers (>30%) don't sell their products. 2. Samsung share includes all market levels, from economy to premium. 

With that in mind, the profitable sector is the premium end market where margins are naturally higher. Up until recently, Apple has primarily only targeted the premium market, even deprecating legacy devices to reduce cannibalizing their own premium new device sales.

That's exactly wrong.

Apple products are used and manufactured far longer than the industry average. Just as an example, the iPhone 4S was available from before October¬†14, 2011 to February 17, 2016.

iPod > iPod mini > iPod nano > iPod  shuffle > iPod app on the iPhone is one of the most studied examples of self-cannibalization.

The longevity of Apple devices is part of their supply chain mastery and increases gross margin, since they can cut costs over the many years of manufacturing the same product.

The next gen product has better margins than the previous gen due to reused technologies, tooling, less waste in more refined process etc. In your example of the iPhone 4S, they reduced cost during that period but they also reduced manufacturing volume. Volume for their newest gen product stays the same or increases making it more profitable. The majority of their profit at any given time is from the iteration of their newest gen products.

13008,2018-10-28,"Spotify Technologies is a leader in a tough industry to be profitable in. Despite making deals with record labels and controlling approximately 40% of the music streaming market, the cost of royalties and added payments have taken a huge chunk of their revenue. The company IPO‚Äôd earlier this year per an agreement with lenders that they would do so to raise capital and own a position in exchange for $1.5 Billion in debt. It goes without saying that Spotify will need creative solutions to become profitable in the future while sticking to their motto of ‚Äúartists being the centre of everything we do.‚Äù

Since IPO‚Äôing at the time of this writing, their share price has depreciated by over 10% as Wall Street begins to lose faith in the streaming giants ability to generate a profit. I believe they are not being fair. While streaming itself is a costly endeavor, the fact remains that Spotify has a wide moat with over 83 million paying listeners. Yet, they still struggle to turn a profit.

When we look at streaming companies like, Netflix, who remain strongly profitable and increase revenue on a year by year basis with subscribers continuing to grow, it makes one wonder why streaming giants like Spotify don‚Äôt implement revenue growth tactics that others have profited on. One such example is MTV. MTV was very popular in the day when they broadcasted music videos and interviews from people‚Äôs favorite artists. Spotify could implement another service similar to the old MTV where artists have another outlet to connect with their audience and attract new ones   with exclusive interviews, behind the scenes, and personalities giving producers and labels another source of income as well as Spotify profiting off of advertising revenue and original content cost that can be monetized.

Spotify also have many podcast channels. The radio broadcasting market is estimated at $18 Billion and whoever commands it is a huge winner that can receive a hefty payoff. Spotify should create a way to integrate existing radio stations to their worldwide streaming service in a way where radio stations can increase ratings and recurring listeners, and more importantly, control the advertising on such shows. The more stations that go global, the bigger chunk of advertising revenue a platform can receive. 

Spotify is up against a monopoly of three major record labels who control up to 85% of all music streamed on its service. It‚Äôs highly unlikely they can survive unless the integrate features mentioned above in an organic way that can generate more revenue with lower cost margins that they can control themselves. Spotify isn‚Äôt going away anytime soon. Apple and Amazon have significant presences but also have deep pockets to simply not care about the losses they take running their respective services. To become profitable, Spotify needs to rely less on the revenue source that costs them the most. 

Feedback on how to make this better or point out flaws in my reasoning would be greatly appreciatedA couple ways to make Spotify profitable",
13009,2018-10-28,"By ""revenue source that costs them the most"" do you mean the streaming music?  That's the only thing I use Spotify for.  If that suffers I'd go elsewhere.

As a result, they can earn what amounts to 3.8 percent a year from ultra low-yielding 10-year German bunds -- more than a half-percentage point above Treasuries. Aside from Italy, hedged U.S. investors would have done better putting their money into the bonds of any developed nation this year rather than Treasuries.""",

13033,2018-10-25,"‚ÄúThe trade works like this: A dollar-based investor buys euros, which currently sell for $1.1574, to invest in euro debt. To hedge against currency swings, she simultaneously enters into a forward contract to sell back the euros in three months at a fixed price, currently $1.1668 per euro. That transaction normally incurs a marginal cost. But now it produces a return of 0.81 percent, or nearly 3.3 percent annually -- the most since the euro‚Äôs inception in 1999.‚Äù

That‚Äôs fascinating. 

So, are these dollar investors buying 10 year foreign debt and hedging the currency only to 3 months? If that‚Äôs the case are they not taking on a bunch of interest rate risk over the forward 9.75 years?  Or, can you actually lock in a forward contract to sell euros for dollars 10 years forward? Where does a retail investor find quotes for these kind of rates?


So what it basically says is that as the difference between 3-month US t bills and 3-month German govt bonds gets wider, then the 10 year German govt bonds gets more negative in yield.  Thus, Germany can finance their economy more cheaply, even as their underlying strength to repay is worse.  Hope I‚Äôm thinking about that right. 

",
13034,2018-10-24,"Yes... To expand further, there is something we call the nominal interest rate and the real interest rate.  The real interest rate is the rate that takes inflation into account... So the difference in inflation is approximately 1.75 percent (according to the differences in return).

Now... If the exchange rate of the two currencies changes and you hold the bonds until your desired currency rate change occurs, you may be able to exchange your euros for more dollars, or exchange your dollars for more euros.

If we add foreign stocks, we can include these:

* ADDYY

* DEO

* LRLCY

* LVMUY

I don't remember the rest of what we came up with, but regardless, backtest and behold. White girls crush the market.

EDIT: I'm back in this thread, and I agree about several of the proposed additions, most notably TIF. A lot of you are asking why I left out SNAP, though. I simply forgot about it, but even if I didn't, it's been public for such a short time that it would screw up any decent backtest, and I would probably not include a company with no history of positive EPS anyways. That said, if any of you put some money into a scheme like this, feel free to add or subtract whatever you want. I am powerless to stop you.

EDIT2: In accordance with community consensus, we can go ahead and add these:

* ETSY

* FIZZ

* GOOS

* NFLX

* SNAP

* TGT

* TIF

What if you used a function to mitigate them. So instead of the sum of the stock, you could use the [geometric average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean).

Lets say you have 2 stocks valued at 10 and 100

If you use the sum, 110, and the smaller stock goes up 50% you only get 115, or a 4.5% change, while when the larger stock goes up 50% you get 160, or a 45% change.

If you use the geometric average, 31.6, and the smaller stock goes up 50% you get 38.7 or a 22.5% increase, while when the larger stock goes up 50% you get 38.7 again.

This way you can combine any stocks, regardless of their relative value, and weight their growth equally for a proper indicator of the field as a whole",

No data, but as for the people I'm stereotyping, you can go to /r/starterpacks and search ""basic"" to get an idea of the demographic I'm talking about. This isn't something I was taking 100% seriously; it's more that we noticed an at-a-glance trend that companies associated with ""basic white girls"" have outperformed over recent history.

Women have enormous amount of purchasing power spending  around 5-15 trillion dollars annually in the US alone. They make up 85% of all consumer purchases. 
92% pass information and recommendations to others.
70% seek in person word-of-mouth recommendations. 
60% share content online at least once a da.
Women look to blogs and social media to learn about products.

I‚Äôm pointing out that there is a trend among women, especially in the same zip code that influence each other. If you are observant in any social setting you can definitely see a trend. Most likely it is from social media...blogs, Pinterest etc.

I know what you meant, as I said the only difference is the image or that matter the marketing.  For example they say some sort of makeup is only going to be sold for a month, so they jack up the price of it but I wager if you do your homework you find another similar product for less.  But with the consumerism in the US the way it is we feel like we have to get the limited edition item instead when we can easily have a cheaper and similar item instead.

>Still, they would rather hire someone from pizza hut than promote someone.

They aren't going to promote people when they don't have to.  Plus as long as they can hire new employees they aren't going to change their management.  Now with unemployment being as low as it is companies overall are slowly changing their hiring practices.

David Rosenberg thinks this bull market is a sham.

In his [Wednesday interview with CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrading Nation,‚Äù](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/23/longest-bull-market-on-record-is-cracking-bear-david-rosenberg-warns.html) he warned that this record-breaking bull market (it‚Äôs the longest in history as of August) paired with the weakest economic expansion of all time has only been possible thanks to the flood of cheap money from central banks. 

He‚Äôs predicting that first we‚Äôll see pain in the corporate bond market, where rising rates will put severe pressure on a handful of companies that turn out to be the canaries in the coal mine for what‚Äôs ahead.

And he‚Äôs not alone.

Last month, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Michael Hartnett proclaimed the ‚ÄúGreat Bull‚Äù market is over ‚Äì and he also blamed rising rates.

Of course, with a record 3,453 days without a 20% correction, this market can‚Äôt keep making history forever. 

We all know there will be a reckoning ‚Äì but when?

One thing to keep in mind is that staying out of the markets can actually be more expensive than staying in.

Say it‚Äôs January 1999 and you have $10,000 to invest.

But it‚Äôs a scary time to be pondering an entry into markets. The Dow is up 25% from last year alone. Since three years ago, it‚Äôs up an amazing 111%.

So you‚Äôre too late, right? Grab a bull by the horns and you‚Äôll end up gored?

Not so simple. From January 1999 to January 2000, the Dow returned another 25%. A simple index fund, even at that late stage of the bull market, would have turned your $10,000 into $12,500.

Of course, a handful of companies did a lot better in the last leg of that bull market.

Just think ‚Äì from January 1999 ‚Äì 2000, Qualcomm returned an amazing 2,487%. Even Apple, which was mired in a disastrous turnaround in the late ‚Äò90s, nearly tripled investors‚Äô money from 1999-2000.

If you‚Äôd looked at the toppish-seeming markets, and took a pass on putting your $10,000 into them ‚Äì you could have lost a lot more than $10,000, just by forfeiting potential upside.

Of course, hindsight is 20/20 as the clich√© goes.

But the parallels between today‚Äôs markets and the Dot.com mania are hard to ignore ‚Äì both the lessons on risk AND reward. 

And even if you disagree with [this analyst that a stock market ‚ÄúMelt Up‚Äù is just beginning to ramp up ](https://orders.stansberryresearch.com/chain?cid=MKT376375&eid=MKT385086&encryptedSnaid=&snaid=&step=start#AST90728) \-- you can‚Äôt deny that 2018‚Äôs biggest winners so far (tech stocks are leading the charge, with Netflix alone up 68% for the year so far) look a lot like 1999‚Äôs tech-heavy list of frontrunners that multiplied investors‚Äô money back then, too.

Again ‚Äì the bull market has to end. But it doesn‚Äôt have to end tomorrow, or even 18 months from now.

And in the meantime, who do you think will look smarter when it‚Äôs over? People who got out today‚Ä¶ or people who ramped up their tech investments (and keep risk management like trailing stops in mind) ‚Äì while they ride their winners into the sunset like it‚Äôs 1999?

I see Netflix producing a ton of content to keep viewers interested to increase their numbers, which can make agreements with content producers far more favorable to Netflix than current agreements.

I don't see Netflix beating Disney at what Disney does best, but perhaps they can convince other content producers that an agreement with Netflix makes a ton of sense, especially if those content producers only need to make a relatively small subset of their content available on Netflix.

In fact, I would love to see Netflix offer more ala carte options, provided it doesn't impact the base content available. Personally, I'd pay $5-10 more per month for more of my target content, but I wouldn't pay that to get more content generally with only slightly more relevant content.

If either option works out (Netflix offering white-label service or offering ala carte upgrades), Netflix stands to make a bunch of money. Netflix needs to continue dominating in subscribers to get favorable deals.",

Honestly NFLX might not have one of the prettiest balance sheets but it's long term business model is a very reasonable/achievable feat. Long term profitability is very likely if they keep hitting their (conservative IMO) growth estimates.

The credit rating depends on a number factors beyond just financial operations like the character of management, what kind of collateral Netflix is providing to secure the loan, and other factors.

My problem with YouTube is that I go there for ""free"" content, produced by relatively low-budget individuals or groups. The ads are tolerable because I feel like I'm getting good value, but I hesitate to pay for additional content because it feels unnatural. With Amazon, I'm already accustomed to paying for content, and I get a bunch of other stuff with that membership plan.

I just don't think YouTube will ever be able to attract the paid subscribership that Netflix and Amazon enjoy. I expect some consolidation soon, with content producers signing on to one of the established brands.

I don't see HBO or DISNEY or anyone really offering add on bundle content as they've already begun pulling content from Netflix. Which is smart.

Not to be pedantic, but let's see where these bonds print tomorrow.

Let's see what price and coupon the new bonds come at as it isn't unreasonable to think they potentially come at a similar yield to their current indentures. If that happens it renders your entire point about rising interest rates moot.

The company's longest-dated paper is a $1.9 billion series of 5.875% bonds due November 2028 that were issued at par in April, therefore originally yielding 5.875%. They currently trade around 98.5, yielding about 6.08% and carry ratings of Ba3/BB‚Äì. Ratings were originally Ba3/B+ at issuance, so ratings are higher now after an upgrade post their most recent quarterly result, and secondary trading levels suggest only a mild increase in yield to be expected. So again, not unreasonable to think the yield ends up being on par/similar with their current rates or in a best case scenario lower.

When you're reading them you want to have a keen eye for anything that seems a little ""off"" - it's kind of hard to explain since there's no 1 thing that people do but if you have a good understanding of accounting you can start to identify this sort of thing.

For example, on Netflix's balance sheet they have $4.3B in ""current content assets"" and $10.3B in ""non-current content assets"". If you read the notes these line items get lumped into their amortization expense which many novice investors either don't consider an expense or look at metrics where this is above the line (i.e. EBITDA and EBITA). If this was considered a real cost it would be above their Depreciation and Amortization lines which would significantly lower their reported EBITDA, EBIT, etc. Depending on who you ask, some will say this is fine accounting since it technically is an investment to license and produce content, and that amortizing it is the correct treatment. But keep in mind that accounting should be a true representation of the numbers in the business and that making a TV show is pretty different than building a factory. Just my opinion on how that should be treated though.

Edit: just pulled up their statements and on the CFS they spent $9.8B in CASH on content asset additions in 2017. Not all cash outlays are considered expenses (i.e. balance sheet line items like PP&E investments), but something like making a show could have an argument.

Edit 2: also, since this line is being amortized, it gets added back on the CFS as a non-cash expense. But you don't keep the licenses to shows once they expire so this really makes no sense.",

The apps are okay, but YouTube gives you a ton of other. I don't have a Roku, but at least on my smart TV, I don't recall a separate ""TV/Movie"" section, so I'd have to search by name.

I've only used the Amazon app on my phone, and I typically use a web browser for Amazon, Hulu, YouTube, and Netflix (occasionally I use my smart TV app for Netflix), and there's definitely a huge difference between the experience on those. Hulu and Netflix are pretty similar (I prefer Netflix, but that's probably because I like dark themes), but I have to search for Amazon's video site to get a decent portal, and even then, it's not all that good.

> Also included with your cost is Amazon Prime Music, which is just as good as Spotify if not BETTER. 

Yeah, Amazon really does have a lot of value. However, I find the video selection a bit better on Netflix, so if you're not as interested in the other prime features, Netflix makes a ton of sense.

I don't pay for Spotify because I don't listen to it enough, so the decision for me is whether the free 2-day prime shipping makes up for the less awesome prime video content. I currently have both prime and Netflix, but I'm starting to want to eliminate one (why pay for two streaming services?) now that Amazon is catching up in content.

> YouTube provides easier to find 4k content

While many tout this as a bonus, I don't think the majority of people will be able to take advantage of it because of higher bandwidth, so it's really a premium feature that most don't want to pay for. I have a 4k TV, but I don't pay extra for Netflix 4k because it's just not *that* much better (I used to have their 4k subscription) to warrant the higher price and heavier load on my network (I currently have 15mbps internet, though I'm considering upgrading to 60+; we also like to stream multiple videos simultaneously).

Yes, 4k will be important in the future, but it's not important *today*. 1080p is *good enough* for most people. People don't need to see regular video in 4k, so they need to back it up with lots of high quality 4k content, and Netflix and Amazon already have a lot of their content available in 4k. I'm much more bullish on them than YouTube when it comes to 4k mattering.

> I don't see HBO or DISNEY or anyone really offering add on bundle content as they've already begun pulling content from Netflix. Which is smart. 

Sure, that's the current trend. But will that be the trend in 5-10 years? I think people aren't going to put up with several separate subscription services, though they may put up with one or two services with addons, especially when it comes to switching from cable/satellite.

I think the larger providers (e.g. Disney( may be able to completely escape Netflix, but smaller providers will likely work with Netflix to an extent, giving a couple of really good shows to hopefully whet people's appetites for more content to drive them to either an add-on bundle or a separate subscription to their service.

Short term (next 5 years or so), I'm a little bearish on Netflix, but I'm pretty bullish long-term since I don't think customers will put up with having a half-dozen streaming services.

> Netflix hosts with Amazon Web Services

Sort of. AFAIK, they also use Google Cloud Storage, and their CDN is still their own. Basically, everything up until the video starts streaming seems to use AWS, but the actual bits likely don't touch AWS *at all* since they're likely coming from a CDN at your ISP. AFAIK, the only time the video stream would hit AWS is if the CDN at the ISP is overwhelmed and they use AWS to handle additional load.",

14311,2018-10-23,"Actually, Netflix is older as a company than Google.",
14312,2018-10-25,"Amazon could've been posting profits for years. They *chose* not to. They *chose* to continue investing in infrastructure and (much more importantly) getting into new areas of business. 

Netflix cannot currently post profits. Netflix is only *arguably* getting into a new business (of content production as opposed to simply content delivery), but they're not really making direct money off of that business, so it's more of a subset expenditure than a new business area. Is there a route to profitability? I think so, but I don't think Netflix is on the same level as Facebook, Google, or Apple in that sense. 

Facebook has effectively shut competition out of its primary market just because of how social networks function. Google is... well, Google; I don't think I need to expand on that, they're a monster. Apple has created a sense of brand loyalty verging on lunacy or jingoism in their customers, and I don't think there's any threat to that at present (though I think the waters are getting more choppy for them up ahead). 

Netflix has none of those competitive advantages. Their customers don't have the same level of loyalty to Netflix as a name or brand. Netflix is not ubiquitous to anywhere near the same level as Google. Netflix has no market effects that lock in their current subscribers. In a general sense, Netflix offers a service that is not, strictly speaking, unique in any particular way. Their only USP is their ""new"" (relatively speaking) expenditure in the form of their proprietary shows.

Amazon faced a very similar problem - they were just the equivalent of a flea market that charges sellers for setting up stalls, and their sellers could always leave them and go elsewhere. They got around this by repeatedly and reliably undercutting everyone in prices on the consumer end and leveraging that to reduce their own costs. By forcing their competitors to either similarly cut prices or go out of business (with most eventually forced to pick the latter), they've established a hilariously dominant market position.

However, Netflix likely can't even do that. Their analogous ""sellers"" are the companies that make entertainment. The market for entertainment has much higher barriers to entry than retail, which naturally leads to much more consolidation, which means that there isn't as much pressure on these companies. Retail companies did not have the time to build out their own Amazon competitors in a world where they have product that they need to sell. Entertainment companies can afford to wait and build their own Netflix competitors. ",

2. Netflix is $8-$14 a month. Amazon Prime is $10 a month. With that you get music, movies AND free 2 day shipping. Hello. The 2 day shipping alone makes prime worth it (if you order a lot of stuff).

3. While I agree that 4k isn't as ubiquitous as 1080p, after I saw the difference at a friends house, I bought a 4k TV 55' for $410 with built in ROKU.  Amazon Prime doesn't charge an upgrade for 4k content. Netflix does. YouTube has MUCH more 4k content than both. But it's a lot of nature stuff. 

4. While I believe that nobody can see into the future more than 3-5 years. I believe that the trend leads to a bunch of splintered content ""apps"" and players like ROKU or Fire sticks (Amazon) will be best for aggregating them, unless the TVs themselves just have something similar built in. But as more and more become brand loyal to Fire or ROKU, I think you'll see licensing deals. And this all ends up eventually costing the viewer the same or MORE than what Cable, or DISH was charging. The difference being, the viewer finally gets the a-la-cart choices it's always wanted. 

5. So you're saying that Netflix pays both Amazon AND Google? sheesh. 

Since we're in the r/investing sub, then why not buy the ISP stocks such as Comcast? because no matter HOW the viewer ends up streaming, they're still streaming using Comcast pipes. Or Centurlink.

Anyway, most start-ups fail: [https://www.cbinsights.com/research/venture-capital-funnel-2/](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/venture-capital-funnel-2/)

This is a well-known problem in capitalism -- incumbents are able to use their capital to ride out waves of failure, and they are usually positioned politically or business-wise to adopt any new idea that is close to their core business model.

Netflix is an even worse position because they moved from a business model that had relatively little incumbent advantage (video rental \[because of fair use laws\]), to a business model that is full incumbent advantage (licensing and creating content). This is, of course, super hard, because copyright is essentially permanent due to lobbying, and new content is not uniform in quality. They are throwing money at the problem and getting mixed results. This is because content creation in Hollywood is just as much about relationships and pre-existing networks as it is about capital.",

14389,2018-10-23,"> can't you just install Amazon app on your smart TV? If not, then my 4k TV with built in ROKU is a better option

I can, but that's not the point here. I watch Amazon video on my computer, and AFAIK that doesn't have a specialized app (esp. for my platform: Linux).

I'm not looking for technical support, I'm looking at it as an investor. What is the customer's first experience going to be with Amazon prime video? They'll see it through Amazon.com, and if the interface doesn't compare nicely to Netflix's experience, they may never get to the ""install the app"" phase.

That's how I started with Netflix, and the app looks the same on my TV, phone, and computer; it's a very consistent experience, and is part of the reason I stick with it. Unless Amazon gets some *very* compelling content, I think Netflix will continue to win in this space except for people who use the rest of Amazon's offerings, and even then, many of those also have Netflix.

> With that you get music, movies AND free 2 day shipping. Hello. The 2 day shipping alone makes prime worth it (if you order a lot of stuff).

And that's not the case for a lot of people. That's the reason *we* keep Prime (I have never used the music service, and I've just started with the video service). However, I'm finding it hard to justify $10/month for a day or two faster delivery, and I tried replacing Netflix with Prime (why pay for two subscriptions), but Amazon's content just doesn't deliver for me. At some point, I'm going to stop justifying the prime delivery aspect and just cancel my membership (my wife is the diehard here).

The combined value is great for some people (e.g. you), but there's a *reason* Netflix is dominating the space, and it isn't just because they're ""first"" to market. They have a superior interface and better content, and I expect that they have higher margins than Amazon.

> after I saw the difference at a friends house, I bought a 4k TV 55' for $410 with built in ROKU

Eh, I disagree that the difference is *that* big. I have a 4k TV (about the same size and price), but I don't care as much about the additional pixels, so I don't bother shelling out the bandwidth for it. In fact, I had the 4k subscription for a bit with Netflix, and I just didn't feel it was worth it.

Standard def to HD was a big jump, but HD to 4k is a much smaller jump.Most of the ""amazing 4k content"" is stuff that would also look great on a decent 1080p screen. I sit far enough away from my screen that I don't think my eyes even notice a difference.

Most customers aren't using cutting-edge technology, so it's silly to base investing decisions on the extremes. Yes, there is a niche that will pay more for 4k content, but the majority will pay more for quality content. People want high-quality shows, and that's what Netflix delivers, and they do it in a way that everyone from toddlers to the elderly can figure out. 

You don't make your money from the heavy users, you make your money from the quiet majority that watches a few episodes each week. You need to attract *just enough* of the heavy users to get your name to the quiet majority, and Netflix has done really well on both fronts. 

> I believe that the trend leads to a bunch of splintered content ""apps"" and players like ROKU or Fire sticks (Amazon) will be best for aggregating them, unless the TVs themselves just have something similar built in

That's a fair assessment. However, I don't think people want to get lacked into a single dongle, especially since none of them handles all use cases:

- web
- mobile
- tv
- traveling

The best interface for a customer is to have a service that operates in all of those environments and have a single dashboard where services can be added and removed. I really hope this is the direction Netflix is going, because they already have access to all of the platforms and worldwide infrastructure that rivals or beats Amazon's.

What needs to happen is for people to start cancelling cable/satellite subscriptions en-masse in favor of streaming services, and smaller channels will flock to one of the larger services. I don't know Netflix's end-game, but I *do* see traditional TV dying, and *someone* is going to come out ahead.

In fact, I'd really like to see Netflix acquire SlingTV for their deals and then roll out a ""live"" add-on that is more reliable than what Sling offers. My guess is that Dish Network isn't willing to give up on it since it (rightly) sees online distribution as the  future, so Netflix is trying to make its brand more valuable so people don't feel they *need* that content, which may get it some more favorable deals in the future.

huge minority there.

I'm not sure their first experience with Prime video is online. Mine was through the ROKU, and it's very similar to Netflix's. HBO's is better IMO.

95 million Amazon prime members,up 10% from last year.  Slightly more in percentage terms than Netflix. 

The music service is top notch. I've used every single music service since Google Play and Amazon is the best IMO. 

2 day is important when you order items daily or weekly. Whether you do so or not is irrelevant as the $10/ month for Prime offers a significant better value than the $14/month Netflix price does. 

Also, Comcast is offering HBO Go and Showtime stream packages that are attached to their internet packages, not Cable. This increases competition significantly for Netflix, as they will ALWAYS need you to pay separately for an ISP.  SO now I'd own AMZN over NFLX as well as Comcast over them. 

First to market is the sole reason. Interface and content is what keeps the brand loyalty. But competitors are increasing and the MOAT is shrinking. Raising content costs for Netflix considerably. Which lowers margins. Disney has best margins on content because of their product tie ins. 

I agree that Netflix's 4k sub price isn't ""worth it"" but the 4k Picture is mathematically better than 1080p. Go back and watch a 720p show on your old screen. Or watch a 4k drone video on your 4k monitor . You're getting spoiled is sounds like!

10 years ago 1080p was the ""extreme"".  Tech moves fast. In 5 years 8k will be the extreme. Prices are falling faster than ever. 

ROKU and FIre do a pretty good job of handing those requests you made. 

It's funny but Satellite providers saw this coming and locked people in to 2 and 4 year deals. Such as me. But ironically, after having a year to research different platforms, I'm still leaning towards AT&T's DirectTV now package. As it gives me the most channels for the lowest cost. I'm also considering SlingTV, which is owned by Dish. 

Smaller channels simply cannot justify the a'la'cart pricing model. They are subsidized by the big boys like ESPN and Discovery.  Nobody is going to pay $4.99 /month for the DIY network. 

Either way, your idea or mine, still benefits Comcast as streaming needs internet, in all cases. 

Dish owns SlingTV. Not going to happen. 

You bring up a very important point. Netflix can't offer a ""LIVE"" option, and that is important to many many people. Amazon is already addressing this with Thursday night football. DirectTV now and Sling both have live options along with HULU (Disney). People want to watch their local news. News and Sports are all that is left for live television, and right now Netflix isn't close to either of those arena's. 

I've been wrong on Netflix's demise for 4 years. I'm still staying away from a valuation standpoint as it has the worst numbers among the FANG stocks. Google just gives you so much more with it's stock than Netflix does. So does Amazon , as an investment and multiple income streams (pun intended).

That may be true, but I don't have any figures to go one way or another. I know they advertise that service on their main site, and when searching for movies/TV shows, the Prime streaming option shows up next to the physical and digital purchase options.

Before I knew about Amazon's included prime content, I associated video on Amazon with pay-per-watch, because a vast majority of their available digital content costs money. That's most of the reason I didn't bother checking out their app, and it wasn't until I heard about other primer offerings that I noticed they had a decent selection of ""free"" content. Maybe I'm the in the minority here, but that was my experience.

> The music service is top notch. I've used every single music service since Google Play and Amazon is the best IMO. 

Again, I really don't know much about their service. My younger friends (20-somethings) use Spotify, my older friends (40+) seem to use Pandora, and everyone I know with Apple devices use Apple's service. The [market share statistics](https://musicindustryblog.wordpress.com/2018/09/13/mid-year-2018-streaming-market-shares/) seem to show that Amazon is in a competitive third place at 12% global market share, but Apple seems to be outpacing Amazon's growth and Spotify continues to maintain its lead.

Google's music service is about as interesting as Pandora's right now: not very.

> 2 day is important when you order items daily or weekly

We do, but I still don't think it's that important. Does it *really* matter if it gets to your house a day or two faster? Most of the time, we don't use the item until a few days after it arrives anyway, so it's not that big of a deal IMO.

People are impatient, but I see 2-day shipping as a luxury that many would be fine getting rid of if they needed to cut somewhere. Amazon Instant, however, will be a *huge* disruption once it becomes widely available. This isn't particularly relevant to Amazon's place serving video content, and I think many Amazon Prime customers also have Netflix.

> SO now I'd own AMZN over NFLX as well as Comcast over them. 

Yet subscribership has only grown with Netflix, so this doesn't seem to be a major concern. Comcast Go is interesting, but most of my contacts who actually use it mostly want access to live sports when traveling, not for other media consumption. They're certainly a factor, but I just don't think it'll ever displace Netflix.

Amazon is also interesting, but they don't have a particular competitive edge. Their biggest value proposition is that they offer a bunch of services under the same subscription. However, people are *still* using their competitors instead of them even though they offer more ""value"", so I think they're fighting a branding issue.

> Disney has best margins on content because of their product tie ins. 

Oh, definitely. I also don't think Disney is a particular threat to Netflix since they have a completely different market.

Disney targets families with young children, and they've solidified themselves as a brand that parents trust. That's not changing any time soon, so parents will follow the content as long as it's not too unreasonably priced.

Netflix has a much wider demographic, and their answer to Disney is: we'll provide just enough content that both parents and children are happy if they can only choose one platform. If Netflix tries to take market share from Disney, they'll fail. However, I see a good case for Netflix to take market share from other Hollywood studios, like HBO, and they just need a few really good series to keep people interested. Netflix offers variety, and the majority seem to want variety.

> 4k picture is mathematically better

Sure, but that doesn't translate to better performing in the market. Bluray is also mathematically better, but consumers still buy DVDs more than Blurays.

I don't see any one platform really outperforming any other with 4k content, so I don't see it as a major point of competition. The most important part here is your CDN, and Netflix wins at that, so they just need access to more content until other players decide to just focus on content production instead of trying to do distribution as well.

> In 5 years 8k will be the extreme

Sure, but that doesn't mean 1080p will go away. We're running into infrastructure limits, and each step in pixel density requires *way* more bandwidth without a major improvement in quality.

The biggest improvements are visible with larger displays. Projectors are slow to adapt, and large TVs are inconvenient, so we need something like roll-up screens (like LG's screen](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/lg-65-inch-rollable-uhd-oled-ces/)), to really make something like 8k practical (though that's still years away).

I think most digital media will be consumed on 1080p or less for the next few years, with 4k becoming a bit more common maybe 5 years out. The big market for 4k is movies, and the content just isn't there yet.

> ROKU and FIre do a pretty good job of handing those requests you made. 

Oh sure, but I only see that market contracting, not expanding. People don't like plugging stuff in, and with SmartTVs becoming more common, I think we'll see those types of devices going away.

I also haven't seen a huge push from TV manufacturers to control TV content, and most seem to partner with existing providers instead through apps. I think the consolidation will happen with streaming providers, not TV manufacturers or dongles.

Yeah, maybe Netflix will get unseated, but I think it's *far* more likely that they'll be able to outmaneuver their competitors, provided they can maintain marketshare for a few years.

> It's funny but Satellite providers saw this coming and locked people in to 2 and 4 year deals

And that's exactly what I'm talking about. Instead of innovating, content producers seem to try to dig in (see push back against piracy instead of offering affordable digital options). Eventually they'll realize that delivery networks like Netflix or Amazon offer a much better service to customers, so they'll partner or die. There are hundreds of channels on Dish/cable, and we can't have hundreds of streaming services. I see things coalescing into 3-5 providers, just like the current and past TV market has done.

The real question is, who will serve that content? And will live TV go away?

I'm very interested to see how Disney's streaming service works out, and I'm also interested to see if Sling can drastically increase its user base. I think more people want to binge watch than wait for live content to become available, so I'm bullish on services like Amazon and Netflix.

> Nobody is going to pay $4.99 /month for the DIY network. 

Sure, but people would pay $5/month for a bundle of similar content that includes the DIY network (e.g. all of its sister stations, like HGTV, Food Network, and Discovery Channel). You market each bundle to a specific demographic.

> Dish owns SlingTV. Not going to happen. 

You don't think a partnership between Dish and Netflix could happen? Dish has the content catalog, Netflix has the user base and distribution network. Many people cancel cable/satellite in favor of Netflix, so this would likely only increase their market share (e.g. I don't have cable or satellite and have Netflix and Amazon Prime instead).

Comcast is a different story because they're also in the ISP game, so I think it's in Dish's best interests to partner with a competitor to Comcast that has a wide user base that doesn't overlap much with their users, and I think Netflix is a particularly good option there.

> as it has the worst numbers among the FANG stocks

I see weakness across ""FAANG"":

- Facebook - lots of negativity about recent data breaches and whatnot (though Instagram is going great)
- Apple - there's been a bit of push back recently, but they're the most stable of the five
- Amazon - continually trying to be the best at everything; their core products are steady though, but they're burning through lots of cash

Unsecured bonds are entitled to the loan amount and nobody below them can get a penny until they are paid off. If a company has $300 million in assets and $299 million in unsecured bonds, next in line gets $1 million and the bonds get all $299 million they are owed. So, all of the equity in a company must be completely destroyed in order for a bondholder to lose anything.

I see Amazon as the clear leader in growth potential. From entertainment to groceries to healthcare to energy and batteries to automobile systems having Alexa. They have their toes in so many varied industries and their ability to disrupt gives them huge potential. I forgot to mention their GIANT lead with their high margin Amazon Web Services that may land them the pentagon gig at $11 billion.

Google is second. They have a virtual money tree with search. Google maps generates billions and YouTube's model seems to be better than others. Now, their hardware offerings are inconsistent and their ""other bets"" are well, long shots . But google maps was a long shot once and now it generates billions annually. 

Apple is a hardware company. There are always rumors about an apple car, or apple funded movie content. But fundamentally they make hardware. Which i believe to be overpriced. Their market share is precarious in some markets. But they provide consistent products to loyal customers. Their assets are top notch. 

Facebook is a mini-google so far. Selling advertising directly to consumers. Their only advantage I see is that their algorithms are better calibrated to their target audiences and advertisers love that for obvious reasons. But Google isn't sleeping on their past accomplishments either.

Netflix to me is the biggest risk, most in trouble of the FANGs. Their mountain of debt to fund more and more content is problematic as their winners and losers are higher stakes than a Disney which can subsidize losers with ticket sales and Merch sales and Park attractions.  Netflix is a one trick pony. Streaming. They've basically turned themselves into HBO. They're a TV station. That's all. And they're only as good as their last hit. Users can leave easily, cancel and join too easily as well. If their content ever falls, they're done. There debt structure requires them to continue adding subs for the next 10 years. nonstop. And the cost of content is only going up.

14473,2018-10-25,"> Amazon... growth potential

I'm not sure how much bigger they can get, and outside of AWS, they just don't have big enough margins. In fact, I'd much rather see them spin off AWS into a separate company and invest in that instead of getting the whole package deal.

If Amazon really does get into medication, I see Costco stepping up a bit more since they already have the pharmacy business in place, and they also offer a brick-and-mortar network that people trust. Perhaps Amazon will be okay with the Whole Foods acquisition, I don't know.

I also don't think they're best of class in anything beyond AWS and shipping. In general, I think they're their brand a bit too thin. I'm worried that people are thinking of Amazon as more similar to Walmart (low cost crap) than Costco (discounted quality goods), regardless of the actual state of things.

The more businesses Amazon gets into, the more competition they're going to face, and if they're not careful, they could risk their big moneymaker: AWS.

> google maps was a long shot once

I don't think it was. It was a bit of a stretch, but it ties in so closely with their core business model since it gives companies another way to get attention. Google is an advertising company, so advertising local businesses makes total sense. They also tie in that location data with regular search results, preferring local results to national/global results, so it just makes sense.

Google Drive was a bit more of a stretch IMO, and I still don't know if they make enough on it to really justify it as a core service. It keeps people on the platform, so I suppose it makes sense. However, some of the other ideas are so far removed from their core business that it just doesn't make as much sense to me.

I'm hopeful that they return to the ideas behind Google Glass, because I think it's a fantastic way to get ads in front of users more of the time. They just need to refine the concept.

> Apple is a hardware company

More correctly, they're a hardware ""platform"". People wouldn't buy iPhones if they didn't have the apps to back it up. I think that's why their Mac line isn't doing very well, even though people seem to really like their hardware.

When you buy an iPhone, you aren't just buying a phone, but an experience. I'm worried that after Jobs, Apple will lose its way there, but they haven't. 

> Facebook... Their only advantage I see is that their algorithms are better calibrated to their target audiences and advertisers love that for obvious reasons

Again, I disagree, but it's a bit of a nitpick. Facebook's value is in how much data they have, not on their algorithms. People freely post very personal things there, and Facebook can use that to get even more targeted ads in front of customers.

Google has different data and they're successful in an entirely different way. If Facebook as a service becomes unpopular, Facebook loses a *ton* of value, which is why they're buying up other popular services (Instagram and WhatsApp). If one of Google's services becomes unpopular, they have plenty more. Buying Google is buying a diversified tech portfolio, while Facebook is more-or-less a one-trick pony (well, two trick now with Instagram).

Both can be beaten, but I'm definitely more bearish on Facebook, especially since they seem to be falling out of favor. Instagram may be enough to keep them going, and they'll definitely make more acquisitions, but I really worry that Facebook is going to lose a lot of brand identity if they can't reinvigorate the core platform.

> Netflix to me is the biggest risk, most in trouble of the FANGs

Yeah, both Netflix and Facebook have the biggest chances for volatility. However, I see a lot more upside to Netflix than Facebook, especially if 2019 doesn't completely destroy them with Disney finally pulling out.

Yes, Netflix is a bit of a one-trick pony, but they've shown that they can innovate, whereas Facebook (and Amazon for that matter) has been buying innovation more recently. That strategy has worked for Google, but I'm not sure it'll work as well for Facebook, mostly because people just don't trust Facebook as much as Google.

Yes, Google and Apple are likely to be the most stable, followed by Amazon. If Netflix can weather losing Disney and maintain subscribership over the next couple years, I think they stand to make a *ton*. I see either steady growth from Facebook or a steep downside, and I see mostly steady growth from Google, Apple and Amazon, but Amazon is most at risk of stiff competition.",

Yet I doubt they're profitable in and of themselves, they're there to drive users to their platform to increase ad value elsewhere. That is Google's bread and butter, and those services make sense.

As for hardware, Google now makes their own phones, so they're definitely getting into hardware. I see this as a precursor into another Google Glass push (or something very similar). There's just too much potential money in AR ads that I don't think Google can let someone else take over.

> I just like Facebooks growth in EARNINGS over Netflix's growth in debt. 

That's fair. I just think Netflix's brand is better right now, and that can help retain users as competition picks up, whereas Facebook is more like ""I only use it because I have to"".

And I'm not so sure Google's data is more valuable. Facebook knows who your friends are, what your interests are, and who you interact with most. Google knows part of that, but not nearly to the same depth. Email is getting less popular, and search is getting competition from social networking. If it weren't for YouTube, I might consider Google a one-trick pony as well.

Google just has more market-share in the ad space, which is why they're beating Facebook. If Facebook can get a viable competitor to YouTube, Google may have to start worrying.

Yes, they lost Disney, and HBO is also going its own way, but there's a ton more content out there that Netflix can get as people leave cable/satellite. That's a bit of a gamble, and I completely agree with you if they're stuck producing most of their own content.

I don't know if that's on their horizon, and the alternative is a buyout/merger with a larger content producer.

Amazon sells goods and services and has grocery store Whole Foods to help subsidize it's content costs. What does Netflix have? Wall Street.  Netfllix has been borrowing money to the tune of $6Billion per year to pay for it's content. Yikes. It doesn't show a profit. Well, that depends on how you look at it. And Wall St likes to look at in whatever way makes the stock price go higher. But I see changes ahead. Netflix HAS to figure out how to keep funding new content without taking on more debt. So, do they start releasing it's films in theaters? They tried, and got rejected. Do they put advertisements in their stream? could be. Do they raise their fees? Most definitely. If there are no advertisers to help subsidize the costs of content, then end users most certainly will have to start picking up more of the bill. 

I've been wrong on this for 4 years now. So don't listen to me. Enjoy your ride. But I think you're really late to the party and there are better rides coming along every day. ",

I've given thought to selling, as it seems Disney is about to become the undisputed king of content and streaming.  The way I see it, most people can only afford to have one streaming service, and right now NFLX is it. But once Disney emerges, they will probably be the default service. NFLX can be a strong #2, but for how long? And will they still command their high valuation?

Their advantages:

1.) small, lean, quick

2.) huge lead in tech. They have their own proprietary CDN network consisting of boxes they install at ISPs and other local points all around the world. It's leaps ahead of anyone else. Even Amazon hasn't caught up... yet.

3.) Content acquisition has been on point. They've faltered a bit of late, but not to bad. This is going to be a problem as a lot of their high profile content has come from Disney.Is $NFLX still a buy/hold?",

14525,2018-08-08,"Innovation has been an incredible source of return for investors through the last decade. Many have pointed to the fact that a substantial portion of the performance of the ¬†S&P 500 in recent years can be attributed to just a few companies, namely Alphabet/Google, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon. This decade has been one of great changes across many traditional sectors, all driven by new technologies. 

Innovation will continue to drive big changes and who knows maybe there are many trillion dollar companies in the making similar to what Apple has been like over the last decade.  I heard Reed Hastings CEO of Netflix speak of the shift from horses to the automobile, horses were the primary mode of ground transportation for 5000 years and the automobile squashed that in just the last 100 years. Imagine what's in store for us over the next 100 years,.

This innovation space will continue to offer great prospects for investors for a long time to come. In the land of ETFs, there are a handful of names that investors are utilizing to get exposure to innovation, I think this short list is possibly the best way to invest in innovation:

‚ñ™ ARKK - ARK Innovation ETF

‚ñ™ KOIN - Innovation Shares Next Gen Protocal

‚ñ™ BOTZ - Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence 

‚ñ™ ROBO - ROBO Global Robotics & Automation Index

‚ñ™ AIEQ - AI Powered Equity ETF

‚ñ™ DRIV - Global X Autonomous & Electric VehicleS

‚ñ™ AIQ - Global X Future Analytics Tech

‚ñ™ ROBT - First Trust NASDAQ Artificial Intelligence & Robotics

‚ñ™ IRBO - iShares Robotics and Artificial ¬†Intelligence 

‚ñ™ EKAR - Innovation Shares Nextgen Vehicles and Technology 

‚ñ™ LOUP - Innovator Loup Frontier Tech

‚ñ™ XITK - SPDR Factset Innovative Technology 

‚ñ™ IXN - iShares Global Tech

‚ñ™ DEC - ALPS Disruptive Technologies 


there are others, but thes are a good starting point when looking to invest in innovation.

Keep in mind that some of these are relatively new etfs, so they are smaller and can be quite volatile as well, so act accordingly, make sure you do your own research.   





Investing in Innovation",
14526,2018-08-09,"Identifying ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù before it happens for most of us is a giant exercise in hindsight bias.

Markets are littered with the carcasses of ideas that were right about the technology but wrong about the investment. In 1860, everybody knew that the railroad was the transport mode of the future. And yet dozens of giant railroads went bankrupt in the coming decades. Rinse and repeat for automobiles, airlines, computers, dot coms, etc ....

Many of these ETFs will flame out because too many of the underlying stocks end up languishing.

These concepts were discovered decades ago but there was not enough computing power to exploit  the benefits. Fast forward today, and different players are enjoying the rewards (and putting some of their own dollars in research). So when trying to transpose innovation with one of these stocks/etfs, consider the maturity time.

It's a very small portion of my overall portfolio but I'll toss a few hundred dollars at it here and there and see what happens. 

I do like the idea of investing in innovation but echo the comments of others in that it's easy to pick winners in hindsight but not so easy to do so before it happens. 

I could always buy an ETF that does some of the things I'm doing but I like to concentrate a bit more than most ETFs do and it's always fun to make your own picks when it's a tiny portion of your money given that most of my money is in boring old indexes. ",

I think it's interesting to see how often we see posts like this pop up on here and the general demand for innovation as an investment theme. Not that I would use it to time the market, but you always seem to see the market shift into looking for the next innovation around market tops.

When I dumped ROBO it's because it was supposed to be a growth index. Instead if languished while S&P 500 grew. So I switched. Would be stupid to hold ROBO that isn't growing with the risk that it has while S&P 500 that is less risky is growing.

14563,2018-10-23,"I'm a long time DIS investor, and people are making some strong bullish cases for it. I'm still bullish for many reasons, but here's my bear case. Disney's goals that they've set for 2019 are huge goals, that will need to utilize a lot of resources, and finances to accomplish. Also, these goals are incredibly ambitious. That being said, I'm gonna continue to hold DIS stock until at least 2030, and have no plans to sell, and in fact they represent about 11% of my portfolio, and I'm completely overexposed to them, and I'm OK with that risk. 

They will likely have to sell a bunch of bonds to reach these goals sustainably, and they also probably won't reach them by the end of 2019. Also for perspective, DIS has traded flat for about 3 years. Keep that in mind, as these ""huge moves"" Disney has made haven't moved the needle, and will likely move the other direction in 6 months when Bob iger realizes how many billions of dollars he still needs to fund his strategy.

As they expand their streaming sports service across the US, through their contract with BAMtech (which I believe they own outright now) there will be some hurdles to delivering decent sports streaming services in 2019. Surges of activity is one, and being able to deal with ""Superbowl"" levels of sudden streaming surges, as millions of Americans all want to watch the same sports ball event at the same time, without any glitches. This will be a heavy load on servers, and that will be expensive to operate, even when the servers aren't at peak capacity. 

ESPN. That piece of DIS is a piece of shit, it's a drag on revenue, and they really need to turn it into 2 or 3 channels already, they really need to scrap the executive team, get innovators, and completely restructure contracts with all the major leagues so that they aren't paying the most for the contract and delivering content that isn't garanteed to be watched heavily. The entire viewer sports sector has a pretty ridiculously exploitative business model in general, especially college sports, but that's another conversation entirely. 

The Disney streaming service will have a bunch if expensive hurdles to deliver their service worldwide by 2019. Yes, there is this little business called AWS and azure that they can pay for to operate their streaming content. Yes they will own Hulu by then. Yes they will own a bunch of services that can deliver the content. But can they deliver the entire Disney library of all their animated movies to Australia, on a weekend, by July of 2019? Can they translate all of their marvel movies into Spanish for South America, and Brazilian Portuguese for Brazil? What if they need to deliver that content to India? To the UK? To all of Europe? Can they stream all of the pixar movies in China? China has a voracious appetite for content, and favorites  spread like wildfire there, but what if the next Wall-E movie has a subversive message? What if the next finding Nemo has record breaking viewership numbers in China, and their servers are simply unable to keep up with demand?  Keep in mind this is their entire content library they're talking about doing this with, Disney movies and shows. ABC. Fox. Marvel. Star wars. The new movies, the old movies. Everything. This is a monumental undertaking, and 2019 is an ambitious goal. What if Amazon and AWS simply cut Disney off from using their data centers, as Disney is a direct competitor? 

The parks sector, domestically and internationally, I have no problems with. This sector will be fine, and continues to beat revenue expectations year over year. ",
14564,2018-10-22,"I'm not sure that a Disney streaming service will necessarily be as great as everyone thinks it will be, and it might not increase the stock price that much for a couple reasons:

1. Building a streaming platform one the scale of Netflix is really hard and really expensive. That's why everyone is stuck with Youtube for user generated video content and the reason that Twitch was garbage until Amazon bought them. There are only a couple dozen companies in the world that could build Disney's streaming site and if they're doing it all in house it's probably either going to be a buggy mess at launch or be years before it's released.

2. It might be less profitable than what Disney's doing right now. It'll almost certainly result in less sales of physical media and could also negatively impact box office numbers.

Not at all.

Facebook: Facebook spent most of its resources in the early years perfecting its social engagement model and then expanding. It started experimenting with ads around 2010. From 2010 until now, it expanded users globally to hundreds of millions and improved its advertising model to drastically increase revenue per user.

Amazon: Amazon also started getting more mainstream adoption in U.S. around 2005-2010. Then it expanded globally, into mobile, and invested into other markets.

Netflix: Netflix was not good in late 2000s. Once internet speeds passed 15 mbps in places, digital streaming became viable. It took off across web, then expanded to average consumers. Mobile helped a lot in recent years. Since around 2012, it also expanded to the entire world except China.

Google: Google has a much longer history of domination in search. It increased a lot since late 2000s due to use of Android smart phones, use of mobile Google search, and also several big acquisitions like Nest. In addition, Google set up what is basically a VC fund and has many new products and services as a result. GMail came out of that, too, resulting in a lot more ad revenues. ",

Additionally, given that the rights to a lot of other content (Disney) is at risk of expiring without renewal, it makes even more sense to have consumers discover in-house content so that they stay engaged on the platform.

The whole point of Netflix *was* cutting straight to the content.

That's exactly the reason I stopped watching cable tv YEARS ago, and just pirated what I wanted to see, if anything. When Netflix popped up, I subscribed enthusiastically, because despite the limited selection and quality in my country, it's still MILES better than cable tv and hours of bullshit ads. Now they're going down the same route as the major networks and submitting to advertising culture which is exactly what NO ONE wants to see. *They are literally poised to start destroying the reason why people signed up in droves to watch their stuff in the first place*, so fuck 'em.

>13 Reasons is based on a novel that chronicles the reasons that drove fictional high schooler Hannah Baker to kill herself, and was initially intended to raise awareness of teen suicide and decrease stigma. One of the inaccuracies and moral failings of 13 Reasons was that it painted suicide as a logical response to adversity. ‚ÄúIt made it seem like suicide was a reasonable answer, and that suicide is caused by others,‚Äù Sullivant says.

In my opinion, Netflix is doing the one thing they can do to solidify their leading position in the streaming market long-term. They are quickly creating a catalogue of content that they control. Assuming the content they make is popular, this control maintains their subscribers, which gives them negotiating power with third-party content providers (preventing them from jumping ship). If they can maintain their dominance over the next 5 years, as the majority of former cable subscribers switch over to streaming, then they can relax a bit and watch the profits roll in since they will be somewhat entrenched at that point.",

Sure, they may end up with a ton of users, but it's not like Disney has trouble reaching an audience. And all the users in the world are pointless if they end up making less money than before.

They also mentioned non-mutable and non-skippable, that would really annoy me. If it's just a simple add that's well matched to the program then I wouldn't mind tooooo much.

15215,2018-10-12,"When I look at Netflix I see a company burning money on Netflix originals with limited success.
Netflix lost its core model that I think kept many users around, it was place to watch shows you missed on TV or catch up. Netflix has moved aggressively towards Netflix originals which I just do not feel will work out with them in the long run.

I see a company that of course has a stable user base and is making strides internationally, but has been top dog in a specific market with lower levels of competition. 

I think that when AT&T, Disney and Walmart release their streaming networks Netflix will see real competition and content will become more expensive with more bidders.

Not to mention the pure amount of content a company like Disney and even AT&T (Time Warner Cable) has to offer. Will people look for other options besides Netflix or is Netflix something people will always have a subscription too. That is a question up for debate, but in my opinion it has to hurt.

I would love to be proven wrong as I am here to learn, I just feels like it is sitting a bit high and soon the market will be flooded with options for consumers. Netflix -NFLX",
15216,2018-10-12,Netflix‚Äôs core model was completely unsustainable. It was a commodity product. When they started facing competition from other streaming services it was the 100% right move to expand from content distribution to content creation.  The only way they can compete is by offering original content that people want.,
15217,2018-10-12,"Netflix is a content creator now just like Disney, HBO, Amazon and even Hulu etc.  For better or worse I think you'll start seeing every major and minor studio creating their own streaming services and keeping their content in house so regardless of business models, I think Netflix has to sink or swim with original content.  With that said, I think Netflix is right up there with Disney and HBO in terms of quality and quantity.  Netflix also has a huge international market now which doesn't hurt.  I do think ultimately Disney comes out a head once their service is up.  If you look at box office for movies all anyone cares about is Marvel and Star Wars these days.  Disney owns all of those back catalogs and will keep making more including new exclusive original content for streaming like the new live action Star Wars series.  Disney can also package more into a subscription like park and Disney store discounts for example in a similar way that Amazon does with Prime.  

&#x200B;

I've had a Netflix subscription since the days before streaming existed and I hardly use it anymore.  I feel like their original content is overly saturated right now.  There was a time when there was like one new show coming out per month or one every few months and now it seems like there is a hundred new original series/movies per month and 90% is garbage like everything else and I am too overwhelmed to sort through everything when I launch the app to find something good.  ",
15218,2018-10-12,"Netflix has a great advantage with their interface.  It's one everyone is used to since they were early to market, and it's bright and engaging.  My 10 year old can navigate it and stay in his lane, as opposed to when I let him watch Sesame Street on HBO and came back later to find him watching soft core porn.

We have Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO Now that we pay specifically for, and we get Hulu and Showtime bundled with our student Spotify account.  We'll move in and out of the HBO subscription depending on what we want to binge, and I imagine it will be the same with the other services when they come out.  We'll have them for a limited time and then cancel and watch something else for a while.  However, we'll always have Netflix for the kids and 90% of the time if something is streaming in our house it's a Netflix show.

At some point, I think there will be a move by Netflix competitors to keep you from cancelling their subscription, whether it be a cheaper yearly option or by limiting how many weeks of back episodes you can watch.  They are still stuck in the cable model.

15222,2018-10-13,"I wanted to add one variable to this discussion that is normally overlooked. Most of the time, everyone talks about 1) price 2) Disney / other streaming services entering the market and 3) original Netflix shows and their quality (or perceived lack thereof). Since those are pretty vetted out in this and other threads, I will leave them alone...

&#x200B;

The variable that I wanted to mention is the question of technology superiority. Netflix is in FANG for good reason. Their tech is incredible. They have been studying user behavior and tailoring UI and search to keep you hooked. Suggested for you, the subconscious submersion in their UI, etc. -- it all is backed by data and \*very\* well considered. If you check out the ""Business Wars"" podcast on Netflix vs Blockbuster this will impress you. Unknown to most, Blockbuster did try and pivot and compete with Netflix on streaming. They even slammed their prices and had the temporary competitive advantage of supplementation with brick and mortar stores. Despite those advantages -- and literally copying the website design of Netflix \*exactly\* -- they still couldn't compete because their tech couldn't hold water compared to Netflix. I think the tech barrier is the most important thing to watch with Netflix valuation versus competition going forward. Disney's (and the others) success will depend on it IMO. ",
15223,2018-10-12,"I see Netflix dominating streaming in the short and long term. Their original content is pretty damn good. One of their biggest strengths is that they don't have ads and everything is free. Amazon is not like that and neither is Hulu, two of it's biggest competitors. Another one is the selection of movies, e.g. Jurassic Park, Dark Knight, etc. It's light years ahead of any other streaming service in content and ease of use. 

It is spending like crazy and it needs users to grow its revenue. The one thing I don't know and may be integral to their success is international user growth. ",

15226,2018-10-13,"It still is. They burn ~$200-500 million in cash to sustain operations including investments in new content every quarter. They've had to raise debt every year to finance this cashflow shortfall and it's not getting better. Q2 2018 saw them burn over $500 million.

Netflix is not a viable company without raising their membership fees, but this presents a real problem given all the competition at a similar price point (HBO, Hulu, Amazon). The one thing their competitors have in common is that they are subsidiaries of larger organizations who can have the capital to subsidize a streaming service to cross-sell other products, but Netflix does not have that luxury.

It's only a matter of time before financiers recognize that NFLX cannot be cash flow positive at a ~$11 / mo. price and that competitors may create price elasticity that will reduce revenues if their prices increase.

It may take a while for this to happen, but it will happen without strategic adjustment. Offering original content is not enough.",

I have to disagree big time with you in terms of Netflix being up there with the likes of Disney and HBO quality wise. This is of course all personal beliefs/preferences but I feel like Disney and especially HBO blows Netflix out of the water in terms of the quality of their movies and shows they put out. Netflix has had some pretty popular and successful shows but nothing like Game of Thrones, The Wire, The Sopranos, Weeds, or any of the major Disney franchises. I think Netflix‚Äôs model with original content is throwing stuff at the wall and hoping something sticks and is successful.

I do agree with you that Netflix original content is unlikely to go anywhere and will be a big part of their future. I just hope they can improve the quality of shows/movies they‚Äôre putting without running themselves into the ground financially in doing so.",

Of course at her age me or my wife are always with her when she watches but it's still good to have everything filtered so she isn't accidentally seeing trailers for adult stuff.  But as an adult viewer, I think the interface has gone way downhill. The move from ratings to thumbs up , thumbs down and percentage recommended sucks in my opinion.  I'd rather just see integration with IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes so I can get a realistic rating before I even waste 5 minutes watching garbage.

The whole point is if you do not like Netflix originals or only like two of them, what is stopping you from moving to Disney because in my girlfriends case, likes Grey's anatomy which is a ABC product and is being pulled off of Netflix.

Maybe they wont actually affect Netflix, all possible. ",
15239,2018-10-13,"I guess my question is can Disney and other competitors create enough content to pull some users away from Netflix. If you go look at the list of Disney movies that could be offered and you would be surprised the sheer amount there are, could that beat Netflix's offerings. Could Disney outbid Netflix for a content that is particularly sought after or begin to exclusively create content for Disney while providing things like ESPN content.

I think it has the potential to go either way. I think that Disney can challenge them on an international level as the global reach the brand is expansive and infrastructure is so widespread.  ",
15240,2018-10-13,I do not think it is anything to impressive. It is not like it is a patented technology or so optimized it is going to push rivals out strictly on the way they deliver content. It could be duplicated quite easily.,
15241,2018-10-12,"They can but the dynamics are more complicated than you‚Äôre making it sound.

First off, Netflix is super cheap.  These other streaming services have to compete on price too, and customer acquisition costs are going to be high relative to monthly fees. In other words, it‚Äôs tough to get customers to leave Netflix because it‚Äôs just so cheap.

Second, a lot of these services face challenges associated with having limited content. Disney might have amazing content, but at the end of the day it‚Äôs still all just Disney content.  How many people seriously sit down on a regular enough basis wanting to watch a Disney show or film that they‚Äôre willing to subscribe?  Further to the point, and more to your point, how many are so willing to watch Disney exclusively that they‚Äôd actually cancel their Netflix sub?

Diversity of content is meaningful. People don‚Äôt want a dozen different limited content offerings that they‚Äôre paying for monthly.  Services like Hulu and Netflix IMO will always play an important role in being broad content libraries.

I think that services like Disney‚Äôs will be successful, but not necessarily at the expense of Netflix. Customers appear to be perfectly happy having one or two general content libraries, and then paying for curated libraries in addition.

So Netflix isn‚Äôt really trying to compete against Disney head to head on original content. It knows it can‚Äôt compete on original content alone.  All it has to do is offer enough original content for people to be interested in it to not cancel, or to sign up as a broader content library with interesting original offerings.",

That's not a bad run.  My personal taste doesn't align much with Oscar/Emmy fare but it's a metric of quality that Film and TV studios use to judge by.  

&#x200B;

Personally I think Stranger Things, Ozark, Peaky Blinder and most of the Netflix/Marvel series have been great.  I haven't watched a lot of other series that are popular.  Beast of No Nation was a great movie.  They have several others that I enjoyed.  I haven't watched much current HBO but I do love Silicon Valley and Westworld and the Andre the Giant documentary was amazing.  HBO is a different because they do a much more limited amount of original so they don't put out as much crap.  For every hit Disney movie they release a John Carter, Lone Ranger or Wrinkle in Time.  But I think all three are generally making better content then most",

My argument is if the content is competing and you happen to like Disney more, have been turned off by Netflix recently what is stopping you from switching over. It just gives the consumers more choice in my mind. Disney is scary to me in terms of competition, large global reach and infrastructure. Can rapidly produce content, not just kids movies, all content including ESPN content as well as Esport content.

Perhaps I am looking at this as potential Netflix downgrade, but maybe should be looking at it more as a Disney upgrade as I think Disney specifically can carve out a large niche and really replace some much needed earnings lost through lack of obsolete DVDs.

&#x200B;

At the same time Disney also has large operations and capabilities to produce content in bulk. They can do it through movies, tv shows and even shorts. I guess the biggest question is will these content coming into the market do anything Netflix's user base or is Netflix something that is not expendable/replaceable in peoples everyday lives. For example, do they buy one or netflix and another service if they want it.",

In AT&Ts/TimeWarner Cable's case, they have HBO that creates large amounts of content and they will have perhaps the capabilities to offer maybe even tv.

I think it is fully dependent upon Netflix's ability to create above average content that makes them stay in peoples houses or can we live without it. If we had the content of say the Disney Family, who can purchase content to add just the same way Netflix can it could create a loss in market share. I guess we will see if Netflix has to lower pricing or something along those lines to compete, because I am sure these companies will do anything and everything just to try the product.

However I do think it is only a single piece of the pie and that's not what I was referring to when I spoke of maturity. I mean specifically the product maturity for Netflix is well ahead of HBO Now and it's not even close.

Netflix is available in practically every country and they've clearly setup infrastructure (localization, compliance for legal stuff, content specific to regions) to be able to do that. The app itself is also available on every platform you can think of and actually signing up for it is painless. Finally, the product itself is miles ahead in terms of UX and feature density than HBO Now.

Disney owns all those companies sure, but we won‚Äôt see a Stranger Things or Peaky Blinders tagged to Disney. It‚Äôs just not their style, and violence/spooky/child unfriendly goes against their core guidelines. 

The thing about original content is that you‚Äôre free to basically do whatever you want. Disney is locked behind their very very strong IPs, but people will get sick of it eventually (Star Wars?).

If they had to make a platform strictly for kids when you click on it and another for adults in terms of accessibility, I am sure they could it.

I never said that.

There will be competitors but it's not going to be easy for them.  Right now Netflix has over 100 million subscribers in the US alone.  They offer premium content ranging from HBO-style shows to documentaries to children's content to YA stuff.  Content that's commercial-free and unavailable anywhere else.   And given that Netflix already as so much market share, competitors have to do that much more to justify to consumers the added expense IN ADDITION to Netflix, let alone INSTEAD of Netflix.

People have gone too much into some of these names and the hype over IQ on here was a great example of why FOMO/chasing hype is often not a good idea.  If someone has a long-term view on something like IQ, that's fine, but after the momentum turned the posts made it clear that a lot of people were just chasing something that had been nearly a triple in a couple of months.

I think people have to do the research if they're interested in this space, decide what are the one or two names they feel strongest about long-term and have a reasonable position size that they can be comfortable with over the ups and downs over that long-term period.

what would be the better choice over the long term (20-30 years) - pure IT etf like the $VGT or broader tech like the $QQQ and why?


I am from the EU, so we dont have the same ETFs, but we have some iShares equivalents which track the S&P 500 Information Technology Sector and NASDAQ-100 index. The expense ratio is lower (0,15%) for the IT index ETF compared to the one tracking nasdaq-100 (0,33%).


I do have some ""VGT equivalent"" ETFs right now, but I dont like the fact, that it lacks companies like Amazon, Netflix etc. so I am leaning to switching over to the NASDAQ-100 ETF.


Your thoughts?
VGT (IT) vs QQQ (Tech)",
15267,2018-08-26,"I don't use QQQ because I've already got more than enough exposure to the stocks at the top of it just via having an S&P fund in our portfolio through a 403(b) with mostly crummy options but at least a relatively low cost S&P index fund.  QQQ is basically FAANG the ETF now.  ""FAANG"" is nearly 40% of it.  Add in Microsoft and you're at 50%.

&#x200B;

It's a great ETF though, just doesn't fit my style since I do not like any one company to make up more than \~2% of our portfolio.

&#x200B;

I do use VGT which has a HUGE Apple position (and Apple is our largest individual position b/c of it) for a small slice.  I like that it includes Visa and Mastercard.

&#x200B;

I also use ARKW which someone else has already mentioned.  It has the FAANG stocks and other speculative tech and tech-ish stocks, but non as severely overweighted as in QQQ. 

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, these are ALL good funds.  I don't use FDN or QQQ but they're every bit as good as the ones I do use.  Nothing preventing you from using a combination of multiple of them if you want.  I have our portfolio set up such that my favorite tech stocks (Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Google, and Microsoft) are all hovering right around my  \~2% max for any individual company.

&#x200B;

I have also found it useful to set up a portfolio spreadsheet with all of our fund holdings across IRAs, taxable, & 403(b).  Dollar amount in each across the top, below that % of portfolio calculated based on that, and going down the first column every individual stock listed and it's weight in every subsequent column in the corresponding ETF.

&#x200B;

And FYI, over the past decade, FDN, QQQ, and VGT are all in the Top 20 non-leveraged ETfs for rate of return.  ARKW hasn't been around that long but it's outperformed them since inception in 2014.",

I would argue that the gap between Buffett's ""Value"" style and Lynch's ""Growth"" style is no where near as big as people make out. Lynch always had a strict P/E rule that prevented him from buying growth stocks that were overpriced. His trick was identifying the growth in businesses before it was priced in, therefore obtaining a bargain. This is very similar to ""value"" where you recognize the value in a stock before others do.

In the meantime, you could put your money in a mutual fund or something safe to expose yourself to some growth while you learn what you are doing.  

Other than that, I think this depends on how long you plan to hold the positions.  If they are long positions, then yes, make sure the fundamentals of the companies are sound, with a good road map, have good current and future growth projections, and are well-managed.  CEO and top-level turnover usually translates to SP volatility and indicates deeper concerns with products or financials.  Competitor placement is irrelevant if the previous fundamentals are true, because the company will become more competitive and take market share from their peers.

Instead of adopting HBO model, where you only release only shows that conform to premium quality standard, they release a huge amount of medium to low quality shows. Netflix originals are already a synonym of trashy shows, even though some shows are pretty decent.

Their content release model is also very flawed. It may seem to be very comfortable for a viewer, but the fact that you can binge watch entire season in one day has some serious implication. E.g. - some people simply can't keep up and can have their experience ruined by other people who binge watched before them, which isnvery easy in current internet era.

This means that people talk about GoT for perhaps half a year, while people stopped talking about Stranger things after one or two months. There is a good reason why episode/week model is popular.",

15338,2018-10-16,"One distinction is unlike some studios, Netflix owns strong customer relationships directly with consumers. 

I think the reason it is not being priced like other stocks in the studio business is pretty simple: 

1) NFLX actually has grown substantially during its pivot to original programming

2) Netflix, per public statements, has an expected cap on spending for original programming (which is quite high, something like $9b maybe??)

3) NFLX bases programming decisions almost entirely on new subscriber views. So shows will get cut if new subs don‚Äôt watch them. Additionally, they have some regional and local language shows that US consumers won‚Äôt ever (or at least for a long time) see. And the US market is probably close to saturated. The real question is can NFLX grow international subs to the point of more than offsetting their programming spend?

To figure out if it‚Äôs overvalued, I think the best course is to look at NFLXs achievable addressable market, and work backwards. But investors appear to buy into the expansion potential.

I completely missed the point of your post. I guess I could say people have faith that netflix is doing more tech stuff than studio stuff and we just can't see it yet... 


I'm not a huge a fan of the stock, but if I was to try and change your mind it'd be centred around Reed Hastings. He's not a content guy a studio guy or a producer, he's a tech guy. He will be pushing this company in innovative ways that we can't see yet.


VR shows, choose your own adventure shows, game streaming (watching and playing), interactive kids programmes...


As they have the studios now (recently purchased one in New Mexico) they have complete control over a show being made from conception to customer viewing. They can build it in ways no other studio can to work on their own platform. Choose your own adventure is a good example... Let's say a horror TV show has you trapped in a house and you're being chased and you can choose where to run Kitchen, Basement, Upstairs?? 


Now to film this is fairly obvious, same starting point, multiple endings with lots of unappreciated technical issues along the way.


Anyone could in theory film something like this, but if Netflix is first to market AND it's popular then other studios will need to follow the same model so that Netflix can put their shows on their platform and have them interactable (that's not a word). Or wait for another platform (disney / amazon) to do a similar thing and release it there. Now would a studio bother creating a show in two 'choose your own adventure' formats or would they just pick the best one? And which one is the best? Probably the one that is known for having the best content already... (that's Netflix).


This then leads to a google-esque upward spiral


CEO: ""Hey google is really important we need our website to be on the first page""


Poor worker: ""Ok let me google (ha) how to get the best SEO and be on googles first page""

More websites structure themselves to be easily read by google, as they suggest, and google gets better results... the cycle never ends. 


Anyway, the same working theory could be applied to any of the avenues, VR, gaming etc.


The responses about Netflix and it's subscriber count is always ""that's baked into the share price"", maybe it is, maybe there's a few people out there pricing based on the disruption yet to come. If it does come my bet is on Reed Hastings. ",

",
15375,2018-10-16,"Hey you said change my mind but nobody wants to try. Well let's try then, shall we...

If you invest in Netflix, Uber, Amazon, etc., you are not thinking debt vs equity or market share. You're thinking supply and demand flowing through pipes, which get consolidated. AKA, winner take all.

For Netflix, the thinking is creators want their stuff to be seen. So they'll eventually migrate to the platform (or studio) that has the most number of eyes. The demand, too, wants to see where the creators are. So they'll flock to where the best creators are.

Could we end up in a model where a few platforms all provide similar number of users and similar talent on the supply side? Maybe. But is that really going to be a stable equilibrium?

You can apply the same thing to Amazon, Uber or to a lesser extent, FB and Google. If you're a seller, you want to sell on Amazon, because that's where the buyers are. If you're a buyer, you want to buy on Amazon because that's where the sellers are. The network effect amplifies the power of the platform.

So if you think we can get to a point of equilibrium where there will be a few streaming companies / content creators with equal-ish amount of users and low pricing power, then you definitely don't want to invest in Netflix. But if you think users and creators will converge on the ""winner"" and the second place will just collect dust, then you want to know who the winner is.",

Why change you mind, you are right. I have held this view since 2012.

I have written about this before, but Netflix is a premium cable channel like HBO or Starz.  It has premium original content and it buys content, it's Achilles heel is that no studio will do a studio deal with them anymore like they will do with HBO or Starz for major movies 1-2 years after the theatrical release.

Personally, I pay for YouTube TV or Sling just for the college football season, but if I were invested in more sports than that, I can see why I'd be picking up cable all year.

for me what sucks is that Netflix used to have better content. They are getting rid of great TV shows in exchange for their original programming. When I started using Netflix in 2010 or so, I was in awe of the amount of options available. I could go back and watch any nickelodeon show from my childhood or so it seemed (Rugrats, Hey Arnold, Ah! Real Monsters, Spongebob Squarepants etc) tons of great movies, and really just a lot of content that I hadn't been able to watch aside from TV unless you bought the DVDs. Futurama was always a staple I watched on Netflix, as was It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Two amazing shows that hold up well over time and have considerable replay value. There are a lot of other examples that escape me right now, suffice to say in the past Netflix had way more mainstream programming, mainly just old shows that were amazing in their time that had worthy replay value. Another huge example I just thought of is The X-Files. In college I would watch it all the time. Now I'm unable to watch X Files, Futurama, Sunny, any old Nickelodeon etc

Sure I like the original content but only some of the shows. Ozark is great, so was the OJ show, Orange is the New Black was good at first...but that's about it. A lot of the other original programming just doesn't appeal to me. It's not bad, it's just not for me. 

The whole thing feels like a bait and switch by Netflix. First they bait you by offering tons of high quality old programming. Then after you're hooked on the service and loving it, they gut the old programming, foist their Original Content on you, and expect you pay the same or more for the service!

In a time when you can stream torrents from your browser...I just don't see the appeal of Netflix. Originally Netflix and other streaming services pulled me away from torrenting TV shows and Movies. Now I'm getting back into torrenting because it sucks so much and isn't worth the 10 bucks a month. Only reason I have netflix is because I'm on someone else's account. For free, I will watch Netflix sometimes, otherwise I won't pay for it unless it improves dramatically. 

Also I fucking hate how they try to shoehorn their programming to the audience. The Menu is awful and hard to navigate. I can't even search by genre, I just have to scroll through ""We think you'll like X because you watched Y!"" and it makes it hard to view all movies/all tv shows etc.",

15590,2018-10-17,"Edit: sorry this is a bit of an essay, but here‚Äôs my thoughts:


Look at what‚Äôs happening in the industry right now. Minor studios are being bought out by larger studios, consolidating the IP ownership. At the same time, many large players are working to or have already launched their own platforms. 

The reality is that the technology of Netflix is not all that special. That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs easy to make a streaming company work properly at Netflix‚Äôs scale, but not every company needs the same scale, and it won‚Äôt take forever for the other big players to catch up to Netflix technology-wise. 

To name some examples, the history channel has history vault, there‚Äôs HBO GO, and countless other ‚Äúsmall‚Äù scale streaming services, just as there are larger competitors in the form of Amazon, Hulu, Apple, Disney, etc. Why? Economically speaking, it makes sense to vertically integrate media companies. You don‚Äôt just get a bigger slice of the pie, you get the whole pie. Furthermore, when the studios have the amount of data the streaming companies have, they‚Äôre able to create shows with fewer duds, improving your margin over time (or at least that‚Äôs what Netflix‚Äôs CEO tells us). 

I do see many studios missing the boat on this move to vertical integration, as the market will become saturated at some point and it may prove difficult for those left behind to acquire customers. Of those who miss the boat, some will continue licensing their content but others will sell to the large players. The content licensing model is less advantageous to both the streamer and studio than the vertically integrated model, so I see it becoming more prevalent over time. ",

>  
>Bulls touting the 21x PE commit a sin of omission, while bears citing a 62.7x P/E capitalize negative earnings for companies that investors judge worth significant positive values.

While I‚Äôm quick to point out the flaws with the two most common valuation methods, i do not have an obviously better solution.

Shorting a speculative biotech may end in disaster but shorting a diversified index of 2,000 companies eliminates the risk that you may misjudge the merits of an individual security. Moreover, it‚Äôs difficult to suspend the laws of economics for a large and diversified set of companies. One would expect a set of 2,000 companies to produce average return metrics. The median ROE of profitable companies is 9.7% and the weighted average ROE is 17.4%. Including money losing companies at a -5% ROE (average ROE of money losing companies is actually -85% ROE) reduces the weighted average ROE to 11.8%.

>The average return on invested capital (NOPAT / common equity plus long-term liabilities) for profitable companies equals 8.8%, with a median of 6.6%. A more generous definition of return on capital (NOPAT / PPE + CA - CL) for profitable companies produces an average and median return of 17.4% and 11.9%, respectively (I round down ROIs >100% to 100% to avoid distorting the averages). Theses returns are based on 2017 earnings relative to 2016/2017 IC.

>These returns came during a strong economic year and are likely to be lower on a mid/through the cycle basis. Nevertheless, as stated earlier, the returns generated by the R2000 appear to be near or slightly above the cost of capital. This is not a portfolio of 2,000 Amazon‚Äôs and Netflix‚Äôs, but a diversified collection of average businesses. Even if you believe that we are in the early stages of an economic expansion, the multiples for the group as a whole do not make sense.

These market cycles have lasted between 21 and 35+ years.

While interest rates are nominal, history shows that earnings of businesses adjust over time to inflation. Therefore, comparing interest rates (nominal) with P/Es or earnings yields (real) is like comparing apples and oranges. Comparing a 10-year treasury yielding 2.9% today vs. 12.4% in December 1980 in the context of stock market valuation or the attractiveness of buying the 10-year treasury is misleading.

>Inflation in 1980 was 13.5% and inflation today is 2.1%. Assuming inflation stayed the same in both periods for the ensuing 10 years, the 2.9% treasury today would actually be the more attractive one in real returns. Its real pre-tax return would be better and real after-tax returns tax would be significantly better than the 1980 bond despite the lower nominal yield.

>Obviously using current inflation for the next 10 years is a stretch and ideally, we could compare TIPS rates which price in expected inflation, however TIPs were only introduced in 1997. I believe real yields (TIPS) relative to stock earnings yields is not perfect but a better comparison than comparing to nominal yields. Based on this assertion I‚Äôm not surprised to find essentially no correlation between nominal interest rates and stock market Schiller P/Es. I would expect a stronger correlation between TIPS rates and P/Es but unfortunately no such data exists. I believe this disproves any logic saying that 3% nominal interest rates justify the current valuations.

**In Conclusion**

I think the valuation of the R2000 index is too high, and it's an interesting topic. But I **dont** have a short position on it, as the idea lacks a good catalyst. Maybe the valuation is too high, it's worth discussing.

However, this is a good example of why you cannot take investment advice from strangers on Reddit. u/Goal1 has yet to defend himself, and deleted his post. I think it's safe to say he misrepresented himself. Stole someone else's work. Was not qualified to defend the work, and essentially was masquerading on r/investing as an expert. I hope no one made any financial decisions based upon his original post.I‚Äôm shorting the Russel 2000 index and why you should too - Deleted by u/goal1",

15728,2018-10-10,"Haha, brutal.

I‚Äôm still interested in discussing the question of valuation, if anyone wants to continue that discussion over here, I‚Äôll post my comment from that thread.

>Alright, lets get substantive with a few random points.
First, its tough to use a lot of your numbers because of your unique manipulations. Without historical data normalized to your rounding and averaging, how is anyone supposed to have a frame of reference for how those numbers compare with... anything? The value in such manipulations seems to me that they can give you insights into the numbers that add up to the index: are the index averages more composed of high-PE companies than they are historically and thus rounding them off causes deviations from the ‚Äúraw‚Äù data? etc. Picking a personal methodology to define valuations and then hoping for a catalyst seems more like... well, just a more complicated way of betting on a catalyst which people have been doing based on ‚Äúhigh valuations‚Äù for 7+ years already without much luck. Actually, there were potential catalysts that actually occurred, we had government shutdowns and unforced policy errors like near technical defaults and the fiscal cliff that were way more compelling than the ones you list here. What is your rough estimation of the probability that one of these catalysts will actually result in a downturn within the next 12 months?

>Second, margins are not actually mean-reverting. They reflect the business conditions of the time (taxes, inflation, relative market power of firms vs. employees vs. consumers, etc.) and so merely pointing out that margins are currently high does not mean that they must fall. For example, if margins are high due to low taxes and automation which allows companies to suppress wage growth for employees, then none of your catalysts actually push down margins and realistically high margins for the foreseeable future rationally explains high valuations. Similarly, margins in indexes (and economy wide) can be growing because they are being concentrated in specialized firms that monopolize their niche. For example, technology allows a larger share of profits to be earned by companies with strong ecosystems that are not able to be penetrated by competitors merely based on the cost of capital (which is what traditionally limits margins). Facebook isn‚Äôt susceptible to ‚ÄúGoogle+‚Äù just because Google can or does invest more in their product, there is a network effect that makes Facebook more valuable just because it is already big. The same goes for Google in the realm of search advertising, they can earn unusual margins in their corner of the market because they aren‚Äôt susceptible to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù competition even from a well funded and determined competitor like Bing/Microsoft. And the same with Apple, who dominates 85%+ of the mobile phone profit share, and on and on and on. If companies are making unusually high profits in ‚Äútheir niche‚Äù and that is the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù, then even when a giant falls, it will be to a company who will come to dominate that niche and earn unusually high profits in its place. This also says nothing about the increasing importance of patents and IP to earnings which are de-facto and sanctioned monopolies expected to earn outsized margins.

>Finally, lets talk about the Schiller PE. Averaging 10 years of earnings is a shot at a dartboard and it basically works on average because there is usually an average of one recession represented in the data. However, because of earnings growth, a recession earlier in that 10 years is less significant, and if you enter a period where no recessions are represented at all then you would obviously expect erroneous readings. This is to say that ‚ÄúSchiller PE is high and likely to go much much higher by 2020 as the last recession rolls off the average‚Äù isn‚Äôt a statement of valuation, it is a statement of ‚Äúwe haven‚Äôt had a recession in 10 years‚Äù, so betting against the high Schiller valuations is doing nothing more than just betting on a recession because one is ‚Äúoverdue‚Äù. On that score, recoveries from financial crises are always and predictably slow. After the worst recession since the Great Depression, it took us more than 6 years to get back to the previous peak employment. Given that we‚Äôve only had genuine economic expansion for a relatively short time, is ‚Äúbetting on a recession being overdue‚Äù really a smart move right now?",
